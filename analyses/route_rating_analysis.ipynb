On this route you will travel through rich forests of ponderosa pines and mixed conifers. There is much wildlife to observe including mule deer and wild turkeys.

Its located in the central eastern part of Arizona and parallels the New Mexico border. To find it on the map, just look for the towns of Eagar (home of the largest stand of pine trees in the US) and Clifton along the Arizona/New Mexico border. The towns are connected by Arizona road 191. You'll start out in a desert environment and end up passing through an Alpine paradise. It is LOADED with twists and turns and even though its in a remote section of Arizona, its well worth the trip. The road starts out in a desert setting near Clifton, AZ ... an old copper mining town. From there heading north and up in elevation, you can stop at a scenic overlook that will give you a look at the world's largest open-pit copper mines. The road will then take you through a canyon as the road hugs some cliffs and continues to dramatically climb (BE CAREFUL). What makes this road so amazing is the big change in scenery you'll see between the start and the finish. The diversity of landscape is due to the change in elevation you'll cover - a 5,000 feet difference from start to finish. You'll start out seeing some nice desert landscapes and then move on into some interesting canyons. You'll see the world's largest open pit copper mine and pass by one of the highest peaks in AZ - Escudilla Mountain (10,800 ft). You'll also see huge pine and aspen forests and some tranquil little meadows as you pass next to the White Mountains and through the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest.  \\\"This was taken at Hannagan Meadow.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nUpdate from 1rock1 on 6/13/12:  \\r\\nThe ride starts at 7500 feet elevation and drops to the 2500 foot level.

There is so much metal in the earth the mountains are alive with rust colors making the scenic views some of the best blending White clouds, Blue skies, and the green pines.  There are no services between the two cities so fill up in Alpine.  Traveling south gives the best views as you are looking out over the Valley.

The Palos Verdes peninsula with its hills, cliffs, and impressive elevation offers breathtaking scenery and its only 40 minutes or so from downtown LA. If you live in/near LA and haven't discovered it yet, you've really been missing out on an incredible coastal area. If you follow the path that I spell out below in my directions, you'll start out on a large hill overlooking the southern coast of LA. From there you can see the Port of Los Angeles and all the huge commercial ships coming in and going out as well as smaller pleasure boats. As you drive you'll wind your way around to the southwest and eventually western coastal areas along high cliffs that give you a great view of the ocean scenery (especially beautiful during sunsets!!!). If you're lucky and the weather is clear over the water, you'll see the beautiful and mysterious Catalina Island. Many people in LA have no idea that such large and beautiful island is parked just off shore because the island often is not visible. However, when the ocean air is clear enough, you'll be amazed at the large island sitting only 20 or so miles of shore. You'll also get a great inland view high above LA's south bay towns (Rolling Hills Estates, San Pedro, etc.) if you take Palos Verdes Drive East detour that I recommend in my directions below. This road will take you nearly to the very top of the Palos Verdes hill where you'll be at a great vantage point over the areas below. This is especially pretty at night with all the lights. Also, since this area has some of the most dramatic ocean views near LA, you'll see some magnificent houses in some really upscale neighborhoods that are positioned to take advantage of the wonderful coastal views.\", \"drive_enjoyment_description\": \"The road conditions couldn't be much better when you compare them to the normally overcrowded LA streets. This road is relatively smooth with gentle twists and turns. If you take the Palos Verdes Drive East detour I recommend, you'll get into some fun tighter turns with steep elevation gains. Keep in mind that some road construction was taking place in the summer of 2003 ... should be ideal when they get done and have all the brand new smooth pavement in place.Overall this is a great road with on IMPORTANT exception. Just after 25th street becomes Palos Verdes, there is a 1/8 mile stretch of road that runs by the coast where there is constant land shifting toward the ocean. The road has some SEVERE dips which can easily dump you if you don't know they're coming. If you are prepared for them with slower speed you'll be fine. Sections of the road in that area are constantly under repair from the cracks in the road where it has shifted toward the ocean. After that the road is beautiful!\", \"tourism_description\": \"As far as things to do when its time to pull over and take a break, there's enough stuff to do to keep you busy for a full day or weekend if you look around. If you like seeing large commercial ships as well as smaller private boats, just head down the hill and find the Port of Los Angeles. There are two large tourist areas near the port that offer parks, restaurants, shopping and some very inexpensive and enjoyable coastal cruises. One of the tourist areas is the Port's O Call Village which is a vintage New England style port replica (apparently filming for TV and movies takes place in this area). Also, the Port of LA has an annual Lobster Festival (in mid September) that is ideal for lobster lovers. At the start of the directions I provide below, you can visit San Pedro's \\\"Korean Bell\\\" or \\\"Friendship Bell\\\" which is located in Angel's Gate park. This huge bell was donated to LA from the South Korea back in 1976. It has a park and sits up at the crest of a hill offering a great view. Also, if you like history, this park has the Fort MacArthur Military Museum which highlights a fort that was built back in 1916. Just about a hundred yards away from this park is another park named Point Fermin park. This park offers tours of an old lighthouse and has a long walk/jogging trail around the perimeter of the park. If you like shopping, then you'll find a couple boutique centers that are found toward the tail end of the road when you start getting back into the more crowded areas. These boutique areas are great places to pull over, get some ice cream, and walk around looking at the arts and crafts. Also, if you want to do something really exciting, take a boat to Catalina Island which by itself, Catalina Island could turn into a week's vacation if you wanted it too.\", \"state_prop_rank\": 0.2748091603053435, \"sinuosity\": 1.312791605889763, \"route_length\": 15.922263033745054, \"loc_lat\": 33.75954168044692, \"loc_lon\": -118.36947385395699}, {\"gpx_file_num\": 34786, \"name\": \"Pacific Coast Cruise; Hwy 1\", \"state\": \"California\", \"user_rating\": 4.76, \"num_user_reviews\": 51, \"num_users_rode\": 95, \"num_users_want2ride\": 64, \"scenery_rating\": 5, \"drive_enjoyment_rating\": 4, \"tourism_rating\": 5, \"state_rank\": 2, \"num_state_routes\": 131, \"scenery_description\": \"This world-class scenic route takes you along the famed California Route 1 starting (or ending) in Monterey California and ending (or starting) in Morro Bay.

Yosemite National Park has got to be one of the true treasures of this country, with so many sites to see and things to do. Having been there many times over the years and either honeymooning, camping, riding bicycles, hiking, fishing, site seeing or dining at the Ahwahnee Hotel, it is just a phenomenal place to spend time to visit, take in the sites and breathe in the mountain air. It is also one of the most romantic sites on the planet if one is so inclined. The views from the elevated roadways of the Merced River, the solid rock mountain scape including Half Dome and El Capitan are truly breathtaking. Of course, Ansel Adams was very famous for his photography here, and there is clearly a reason as to why. (continued below)\", \"drive_enjoyment_description\": \"(see continued description below)\", \"tourism_description\": \"However, that being said, of all the seasonal activities that one could possibly muster in Yosemite Park, there is one particular activity that most tourists and visitors will never witness, and that is having the experience of traveling on a 2-wheeled motorcycle through this elevated park setting. While our final destination will ultimately be just southeast of Yosemite Park at Mammoth Lakes-California for the night, it is truly a therapy cruise through the Southern Sierra Mountains over the sweeping tree and granite lined roads, only to cross over Yosemite's Tioga Pass at a 9,945-foot elevation. Tioga Pass is the highest automobile pass in California, and then descends immediately downhill some 4,000-feet to Mono Lake to about a 6,000 foot elevation. It's a pretty cool feeling when you stand on a mountaintop vista point at nearly 10,000 feet elevation, along side your close friends and their bikes, knowing that you are quite simply on top of the world. There are not many feelings or experiences like that as far as we're concerned, and memories like these will certainly last a lifetime.Each year we start our ride from the greater San Francisco East Bay Area, meeting at The Old Mill Restaurant in Modesto, California. Once there, we mixmingle having a hearty breakfast before we set out to gas up and cruise east on highway 132 and into the Sonora foothills through Gold Rush mining towns as La GrangeCoulterville. These old time mountain towns still resemble the Gold Rush era with Historical landmarks, buildings and restaurants such as the La Grange SaloonGrill and Coulterville's Jeffery Hotel. Both places provide good food in a casual environment and serve ice-cold beer on over 100 year old carved wooden bars. Every Saturday and Sunday you'll find quite a few motorcycles parked outside of both locations as well as tourists on weekend drives. Highway 132 is an excellent back-road connection from the Central Valley to the Sierra foothills and onto Yosemite.Leaving Coulterville we continue eastbound until we pass through Buck Meadows and onto the gateway of Yosemite Park located at Big Oak Flat, which is the West gate entrance of Yosemite National Park and at approximately a 3,000-foot elevation. Once in the gate, we are now onto the Yosemite Park property with approximately 80 miles to go to reach the East gate at Lee Vining-California to highway 395. There is a $10.00 fee per motorcycle to enter the park as a \\\"drive thru\\\" pass and is good for 7 days at all gate entrances in the park. We usually buy the $40.00 annual pass as it's good for 1 full year and allows you unlimited access into the park with any type of passenger vehicle. Taking a short break at the gate, we may want to put on or take off some additional layers of clothing depending upon the weather situation. We're about to embark on a 2-wheel climb from 3,000 to nearly 10,000-foot elevation in about 60 miles.Heading east from the Big Oak Flat entrance gate, we start the climb up the roadway and into the mountains. Our next stop will be to Crane Flat where we normally gas up. This gas station is the only one at this particular point in the park and on the route we are taking, and quite a distance from either the White Wolf and Tuolumne Meadows fuel stops. (White WolfTuolumne Meadows fuel stops, lodgingfood are closed during winter months). So it's fairly wise to gas up and not risk running out of petrol somewhere along the way to the Eastern side of the park. Besides, stopping for gas allows us to stretch out, have a quick snacksomething to quench our thirst to refuel ourselves. Then, we're back onto the bikes and heading Eastbound and through the park on Tioga Road.Now, this next part of the trip is where the ride starts to get really exciting. We're about to cruise some 70 miles over sweepingwinding roads, and within some of the most beautiful and natural scenery known to mankind, clear to the east side of the Park. The 2-lane paved road surfaces are very smooth and in excellent condition, having a natural glitter effect cast into the asphalt from local quartz stone used to build the roads, and appears like jewels buried into the roadway. With the right amount of sunshine you really think that you are riding on a road of jewels. Pretty cool stuff. The motorcycle engines purr and echo amongst the trees as we lean into the next curve, breeze in our faces, climbing upwards to the next bit of straight away and into the next upcoming curve. Because many tourists and visitors of the park use all roads quite heavily during the open seasons, they are maintained well and in excellent condition. There are turnouts and vista points available every so often that allows for speedier traffic to pass slower moving traffic, and where you can stop to rest, take pictures and even catch a hiking trail or drop a line into the water. Various campgrounds and cabins are scattered along this route and offer a place to stay if so inclined. However, be aware of Ranger Rick with radar in his Ford Expedition as he is out there and will snag any rebel that decides to blast through the park, and especially motorcycles. While the roads are certainly crafted like Laguna Seca Raceway, it's simply not the place to race. Besides, while our group is comprised of Harley's, BMW's and various high end sport-bikes, we tend to cruise the roadway at a decent and honest clip with the intentions of seeing and smelling the flowers, and with plans to do it again next year.While cruising in between the 100-foot tall trees that line the roadway, you pass by large open meadows covered with colorful natural flowers and blooms as well as occasional cascading waterfalls along the roadside as well as off into the distance. Cruising through this stretch of Yosemite wilderness is totally an awesome treat, and often find yourself scanning the landscape for grazing deer, occasional bear, mountain climbers navigating a rocky 90 degree face or a fly fisherman wading in a stream. Lake Tenaya is near the crest of Tioga Road and really is one of the most beautiful alpine lakes you'll ever see. It's amazing that so many scenes we pass could actually become postcard material.Once at the Tioga Pass checkpoint, it's time for a short break to stop, stretch out and snap a few pix of the group and scenery. This is the point of the ride where we start the dramatic drop to highway 395. Once back onto the bikes, we trek downhill approximately 20 miles over the lazy curves and long straights of asphalt where you can actually see for miles well off into the distance that covers the remaining eastern portion of Yosemite Park, the cliffs, gigantic jagged granite mountains, Mono Lake and clear into the state of Nevada. Beware, as there is a somewhat straight stretch of roadway on this part of the ride, with some \\\"S-curves\\\" thrown in, that is a shear total cliff drop-off that must be some 2,000 feet straight down and into the valley. Needless to say, you don't want to misjudge any of these curves especially when the bikes gain speed heading downhill. Regardless, this part of the ride goes by quickly and winds up at the base of highway 395 where we'll stop to take our last break, and gas up our bikes for the last leg of the trip to Mammoth Lakes, some 25 miles south. The quaint town of Lee Vining borders Yosemite National Park from the West and Mono Lake from the East. There you'll find motels, shopping, restaurants and just about all you need to see you through. We've found that the best breakfast in town is \\\"Nicely's\\\" right on the main road.As mentioned at the start, of all the bike trips that I have ever been on, and it has been many, this Yosemite ride has to be one of the most incredible stretches of road and scenery to travel.

Something however kept us heading up to this route (from intersection of route 92 and rt 65) and we are SO GLAD WE DID!  Once you get through Cedaredge, CO you start to get a view of the Grand Mesa and there is hope. Once you start climbing the roads and begin entering into the Grand Mesa you ride through groves of Aspens and Scrub Oak trees and if you time this in the fall when enough of the leaves have started to turn, this may be some of the most beautiful scenery you will ever see.  As you get towards the top, the view back onto the valley and the surrounding towns and way beyond, are amazing too.  The pictures I took did NOT do it justice.  Finally you reach the top of the mesa (which means flat top area with steep sides), you'll ride around an alpine paradise with plenty of lakes and nice hiking trails.  Eventually you start going down the back side of the mesa, the views to the northwest are miles and miles of incredible white and gray canyon walls off into the distance and it looks like a completely different land than the lush forested areas you are looking from.   As you descend the side you'll ride through golden, orange, and maroon groves of Oaks and Aspens.  The road conditions are very good as it looks like it was paved in the last few years.  Finally you meander down the backside (north face of the mesa) and you may be fooled into thinking the good stuff is over as it again turns a bit barren looking for a few miles.  Then Route 65 runs straight up to a canyon wall and is forced to take a hard left and part two of this beautiful run starts.  You meander along the northern edge of a rushing river on the left and beautiful white rock canyons walls on the right.  I'm guessing these walls were from 30-50' high and they perfectly parallel the road and is it gently winds its way for what I'm estimating would be about 15 miles.  And making this incredible scenic winding road even better is that the road pavement was in perfect condition (by the dark color I'm estimating it was paved this year or maybe last) AND on that day (a Thursday) the traffic was very sparse.

Pick up a park brochure from the self-service box at the entrance gate, then follow the hard-packed, sandy road about half a mile through low palmettos to the small dam and unpaved parking area. Here you'll see a sweeping view of the Guana River tidal marsh and adjoining Guana Lake. Check on the information board at the dam for maps of backcountry roads and ranger-led events. The best times to view wildlife are early morning or late afternoon. The osprey is one of about 185 bird species found in this area, along with migrating birds. Falcons and hawks can be spotted in fall and winter, and sometimes the rare peregrine falcon as well. At the dam look for brown pelicans paddling on the water and squatting on the shore. Oyster beds, which look like grayish-black clumps in the muck on the south side of the dam, are exposed at low tide. Look in the marsh here for large wading birds, such as great blue heron and great white heron.If you're up for it, you'll be able to take advantage of some hiking where you'll spot white-tailed deer, gopher tortoises, raccoons, and elusive bobcats. The lake and inland trails are popular during hunting seasons.

Two of which you will pass will be South and North Beach. Parking for South Beach will be on the left. The beach is across the highway. This beach is often crowded, so you may choose to continue north on A1A another 1.2 miles to North Beach, where parking is also on the left. Neither beach has a fresh water source, and the restrooms are port-a-johns. Whichever beach you choose, you'll find 30- to 40-foot sand dunes punctuating the landscape, supporting such plant life as prickly pear cactus, cabbage palm, palmetto, sea oats, and beach wildflowers such as fire wheel and Indian blanket. Climb the wooden observation decks at each beach for a bird's-eye view of both the Atlantic Ocean and Guana Lake. The decks are also a good place to look for birds and migrating right whales, which calve near the shore during the winter months. Taking the boardwalk down to the beach, you can walk along the high-tide line to examine seaweed, driftwood, starfish, sea slugs, and shells tossed up by ocean waves. (Today most beachcombers take only the shell skeletons, leaving the live ones to reproduce.) If you are interested in visiting a golf resort, you can continue from the park beaches north about 2 miles to Ponte Vedra Beach.

Our groups never stop there as we just continue on to Sun Valley which is home to many 4-star restaurants. Camping abounds in this area. There are more camping areas than I can count. Probably the best is Red Fish Lake which has cabins for rent and camping areas all along its shoreline. Many tourist attractions exist for photo shoots of the breathtaking Sawtooth Mountains. Galena Summit, one of our favorite twisting mountain roads, has two attractions that folks can pull off and take pictures. One stop has bathrooms.\\r\\n      Special_notes: If one is in the area and decides to make this trip, be advised that gas stations are few and far between. We ALWAYS gas up in Stanley, regardless of their gas prices (generally a few cents higher than Boise, but that's about it). A couple of us who had Honda RC51's would actually gas up in Garden Valley due to the bike's aggressive gas consumption. Bring a good camera as there are plenty of photo opportunities.

Beautiful scenery, antique shops, flea markets, as well as mall shopping if that's your thing. Small towns, big towns, fancy food, fast food, it has it all. I mention eating at Dockside while we was on the River View Road. We arrived, waited, placed our orders,(there was 8 of us), and then waited again. For over an hour. The place wasn't that busy, so I don't know what the problem was. The guy brought our food an hour later, but offered no explanation. The other members had been here before and the service was a lot better I guess or they would not have returned. One other noteworthy thing to mention here. As we pulled out of the parking lot back on to River Beach Drive, there was this HUGE crater about the size of a VW right on the edge of the road. 7 riders made it around no problem. I was number 8. I was watching a car across the street trying to determine if he had the right of way or if I did. Also there is a blind curve coming from the same direction. Anyway, long story short, I was watching the car, the blind curve, but not the road in front of me. The crater swallowed my Ultra Classic with me on it, and spit us out the other side. I landed on my back in the grass with a few bruises and the wind knocked out of me. My bike had some road rash on the saddlebag crash bars. Extremely lucky to say the least. Anyway, for my part, I will pick someplace else next time to eat. Like Avanti's, (Italian), in the middle of Peoria. A little out of the way, but the food, service, and prices were great. The address is: 1301 West Main Street, Peoria. To reach it, you have to go back to where you first crossed over the Illinois river. Instead of the right hand lane, stay in the left hand lane and continue downtown to North University. Take a left on University down to West Main Street. Avanti's is right on the corner of Main & University. Across the street is a Starbucks for those so inclined.

As far as wild life, you'll see plenty of birds and even bald eagles at the right time of year!

The main street through town has both sides full of funky gift and antique shops, restaurants, ice cream and fudge, pubs and grubs, and funky artisan shopping galore.  Satisfy your sweet tooth with a couple of choices in ice cream and fudge shops, it's all good.   For those who speak Chardonnay and Merlot, there is a winery to enjoy drink and dine on their patio overlooking the mighty Mississippi.  I'm sure you may even leave with a bottle or two to enjoy once home.  Bring your appetite because on the main drag and on the road closest to the river there are several bars and restaurants serving any and everything from burgers, biker BBQ, and fish and all things aquatic (yes, frog legs too) from the simple fish shack where you eat out of a basket on their patio overlooking the river to more formal dining in restaurants that have indoor aquariums where large fish stare at you eating their smaller cousins.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you are not looking for a feast of fried fish goodness of Grafton, take the ferry over to the Missouri side of the river and do lunch at the Wittmond Hotel where you will enjoy a mess of fried chicken, roast beef and all the fixings served family style.  If you want lighter fare, pack a picnic lunch and keep heading north of Grafton and have a picnic at the beautiful Pere Marquette State Park.  You can spend the better part of the day walking, eating and shopping in and around Grafton.  And you still have all of Alton to discover before and after your ride.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlton offers plenty of pre-ride or post-ride options for before or after the trip to Grafton is complete.  Downtown Alton hosts some great pub and grubs as well as some additional shopping options in and around the downtown streets.   At the base of \\\"the hill\\\" you cannot miss a brightly lit place called the Alton Belle Casino.  Good parking lot with so-so in and out access over some railroad tracks, but that's not a deal breaker for those experienced with going over the rails.   If you are looking for some video or table action, or a show, they usually have a good crowd no matter the hour.  They even have penny slots so if Grandma is with you and she doesn't want to make the ride up to Grafton, just drop her off with a sack of coins and she'll be set for the day.   Up the hill from the casino there are several choices for pubs and grills.  Further up the hill are some half a dozen or so antique shops, coffee shops, pie and bakeries too.  Head over the hill and you'll find some additional bars as well.  Keep heading down the hill and you'll see the adult toy store and a couple of blocks past that, you'll notice pink lights of a different kind.  Fast Eddy's Bonaire is a kick-ass rock and roll bar with cheap eats and advertises the coldest beer in town.  Good food, great music and having their \\\"bike only parking area\\\" (to the left up the hill from the corner entrance is nice.

In this town you can take a ride on an old train following the path of the channel. The train makes a roundtrip of about 32 miles. The train runs on weekends and holidays (call the Connersville COC for more information at 765-825-2561). - Metamora. This small Indiana town has over a hundred stores and shops spread out along the canal and various streets. Here you can take a half-an-hour trip aboard a canal boat being pulled by a pair of horses. - Oldenburg - known as the 'village of spires' because of its many buildings with tall steeples. The town has some very impressive immense brick structures built by the early German Catholic settlers to remind them of their native German villages. - Batesville has the quaint little Sherman House Inn that resembles a cuckoo clock. The Sherman House offers a great German lunch buffet. - New Trenton is where you will find the Town and Country Gift Store in a building dating back to the early 1800s. - Brookville will give you access to the 15-mile reservoir known as Brookville Lake. Here you can enjoy boating, fishing and camping. - Heading north on 101 you will be able to enter both the Mounds State Recreation area and the Whitewater Memorial State Park. - In Richmond Indiana you can visit the historic district and see lovely antique homes, shops and restaurants. US 40 was once known as the National Road and runs through Richmond. In this town you can visit the Old National Road State Welcome Center and learn about the history of the National Road. - The drive from Richmond to Centerville along US-40 is loaded with about 900 antique dealers. In Richmond you can see the Lantz House Inn, which was a famous Inn that where the original owner built 'Conestoga wagons' used by pioneers heading west into the new frontier. Today this French-style brick home built in 1823 is operated as a bed and breakfast.

You might enjoy just cruising around the campus or the town with its famous collection of limestone buildings. Indiana University has a great art museum with works from famous artists such as Picasso and Andy Warhol. Every spring (April) the college holds a local favorite bicycle race called the Little 500. The old Kevin Costner movie - Breaking Away - was partially inspired by the Little 500 and scenes from the movie were shot on the campus. An early 20th century artist by the name of Theodore Clement Steele has a state historic site built in his honor just south of the town of Belmont off or route 46. You may see some of the fine furniture and decorations he created as well of some of his paintings. The site also offers walking trails that will let you see some of the very scenery that inspired his work. Keep going south and you will find a large reservoir known as Monroe Lake. When you get back on the route and continue heading east along Rte. 46, you will come to Nashville Indiana. Nashville Indiana has grown to become one of the more popular country heritage towns in the Midwest. This town is known for its artists, art galleries, antique collections and craft shops as well as being the home of the John Dillinger Wax Museum. Further along the route you will definitely want to take a detour into Brown County State Park. Here you will find a small collection of some of the nicest motorcycle roads in the state. You will enjoy the curves and climbs even though the park has relatively slow speed limits. You could spend a nice weekend in the park. The park offers accommodations such as camping, cabins, a lodge hotel, trails, water sports and hiking. The route then heads south on Rte. 135 finally giving you a chance to open it up a bit. The road meanders through a winding coarse that takes you through southern rural Indiana. You will pass by another State Recreation Area (Starve Hollow) and through a nice country Indiana town - Salem. Next you will pass through Indiana's first capital established in 1816 in the town of Corydon. You can checkout its limestone capital building. Corydon also offers a 16-mile scenic railroad tour that travels roundtrip through the local forest and hills. Just to the south of Corydon you will find the site where Indiana's only Civil War battle took place. Here an outnumbered state home guard surrendered to a vastly larger Confederate force. The Confederate's stole fresh supplies and horses and continued on their way. At the southern tip of the route you will find Squire Boone Caverns. Squire was a brother of the famous Daniel Boone and once used a local cave to hide from some pursuing Indians. He later returned and settled in the area. Today a very small pioneer themed amusement park offers a taste of pioneer history as well as tours of the areas caverns.\", \"state_prop_rank\": 0.11320754716981132, \"sinuosity\": 1.1831582676724814, \"route_length\": 59.80310886059205, \"loc_lat\": 38.742383953947474, \"loc_lon\": -86.16444258999226}, {\"gpx_file_num\": 34908, \"name\": \"Goldring Road, La Porte, IN\", \"state\": \"Indiana\", \"user_rating\": 3.67, \"num_user_reviews\": 7, \"num_users_rode\": 1, \"num_users_want2ride\": 0, \"scenery_rating\": 4, \"drive_enjoyment_rating\": 4, \"tourism_rating\": 1, \"state_rank\": 21, \"num_state_routes\": 53, \"scenery_description\": \"Scenery is limited to the wooded area the road was carved through, along with some rural residential areas.\", \"drive_enjoyment_description\": \"I call this road the \\\"Dragon\\\" of Northwest Indiana.

The day we rode was very hot and still, a cool drink and head dunk felt mighty good. Riding along the river allows many opportunities to pull off to explore trails or take a dip. Keep your eyes peeled and you will see some big rocks with a ladder on them which you can climb on and jump into river. Now you will come upon the Nada Tunnel. My friend who told me about this route didn't tell me about the tunnel. I really don't call it a tunnel. I say it is a 12 ft. by 12 ft. by 900 ft. hole in a mountain.

I would caution to take it easy as it is a local road and some are just putting along. Watch for the Nada Tunnel which is after the spring a little bit. Keep watching for the 12 ft. clearance signs. Each entrance to the tunnel is out of a small curve so go slow and peek in first. I made a lot of noise going through the tunnel i.e. blowing my horn, revving my motor, and such.

We haven't stayed at this State Park Lodge but if they are as nice as the rest I'm sure it would make a great stay, and their restaurants always have good food if you need a bite to eat. We are going back this way next summer and hope to stay at lodge and explore some more of the area. Maybe even take that swim this year. Going east through the Nada Tunnel This is the Gladie House that can be found off of 715. You can't go inside it but you can walk around the property Here is Sky Bridge.

This was a one time self-sufficient colony for a group of Shakers who arrived here back in 1805 from the New England area. The colony disbanded about a hundred years later. The town is on display and many of the buildings have been restored and are available for tours for a small fee (606-734-3314). - Harrodsburg is Kentucky's oldest permanent settlement built in 1775! It was constructed as a \\\"palisade village\\\" to provide protection against hostile Indians. At Old Fort Harrod State Park (606-734-3314) you can see a mock up of the old fort as well as the cabin where Abraham Lincoln's parents were married in 1806.

You will be traveling along the nation's first attempt at a federal road that was built back in the early 1800's to encourage settlers to journey into the new frontier to the west. It is known as the 'Old National Road' and along this route you will see one of the few remaining toll-gates designed to help pay for upkeep of the road. Settlers would use this road as their launching point for destinations as far as Oregon, San Francisco, Santa Fe, and Colorado.This route also covers ground where young 22-year-old George Washington led British troops against the French. This act lead to the beginning of the French and Indian war which was one of the factors leading to the England's policy to tax the colonies. It was this 'taxation without representation' that provoked the colonist to rise up against their English King leading to the Revolutionary War. And as if completing a circle it was George Washington who led the colonist to victory and the birth of the greatest nation on earth.This route also passes by the Antietam National Battlefield. It was here where the bloodiest day of battle (September 17, 1862) was fought in the entire Civil War. You can learn about the battle that took the lives of 23,000 men at the visitor center and tour the battleground on your bike or on foot.The scenery on this route is outstanding because of its path through the Allegheny Mountains in the Maryland panhandle. Much of the route takes place near rivers, creaks and in valleys and you will be able to see some waterfalls. Past the town of Cumberland the route takes you up against some 1,000-foot bluffs.\", \"drive_enjoyment_description\": \"This route has some really great motorcycle roads. They have a good amount of twists, turns and climbs and it typically they are not very crowded.\", \"tourism_description\": \"The route's amenities are mostly nature or history based (ex. Parks and landmarks) however, there are a few towns along the way that will offer some urban amenities. Some of the highlights of the route are shown below (described while traveling from east to west along the route):- Fredrick is a good size community and a good place to start out with a meal and fill up on gas. There is a historical home on West Patrick Street where a women by the name of Barbara Fritchie stood up to the great Civil War general Stonewall Jackson. She defiantly flew our nation's flag despite the fact that his troops were overrunning the area on the way to Antietam. Legend has it that she told the General himself 'Shoot if you must this old gray head, but spare your country's flag.' Jackson, being moved by her resolution, shouted that any man who touches 'a hair on her head, will die like a dog.'- Along 40A, about 12 miles west of Fredrick, you can visit Washington Monument State Park and the first memorial to George Washington. Back in 1827, the citizens of Boonsboro marched 2 miles up a mountain to hand lay the stones into place that formed this monument. The monument stands 34 feet tall and has been the pride of Boonsboro ever since.- See the Antietam National Battlefield (301-432-5142) and spend some time at the visitor center learning about the history surrounding the bloodiest battlefield in the civil war. Hagerstown is one of the larger towns you'll find on the route and if you would like to see a glimpse of life in the 18th century head to the articulately restored Hager House (301-739-8393).- Hagerstown is also interestingly situated only a few miles west of Cato tin Mountain Park. This park is the home of the highly guarded Camp David used by our Presidents as a remote planning location.- Fort Frederick State Park (near and south of Indian Springs) is where you can see one of the many forts built to protect settlers back in the 1700s. The fort's walls are made of stone and stand 17 feet high and are 4 feet thick.- In the Green Ridge State Forest there is an old tunnel that travels under a canal. You can walk through the tunnel to a picnic area on the other side - bring your flashlight and bat repellant.- In the town of Cumberland you can visit its historical area and see the end of an important historical canal. Construction of this canal began back in 1828 and it began about 120 miles back to the east in Washington D.C. The canal's life was ended by the introduction of the railroad as a means of traveling to the west. Rte. 40A west of Cumberland travels the same path as the 'Old National Road' that took settlers as far west as the Pacific Coast. You may see some decaying old stone mile markers along the path or even a tollbooth where the families in covered wagons would stop and pay a fee to continue on the stone paved road. Cumberland also has a restored 1913 railroad station where you can board an authentic coal burning train and take a beautiful roundtrip train-ride from Cumberland to Frostburg. Call the Western Maryland Station Center for schedule and fee information (301-777-5905 and 1-800-TRAIN-50).- In the town of Grantsville you will see Amish and Mennonite communities that have been there for nearly 200 years. If you want to stay at a historical Inn, try the Casselman Hotel, which provides each room with a stone fireplace. At the Penn Alps center and Spruce Forest Artisan Village you can see handcrafting skills being taught and displayed (whittling, basket weaving etc.).- The route ends when you head south on Rte. 219 and stop at the Cove Overlook.

Alpena is a coastal town that has a reputation for hazardous waters that have wrecked about 80 ships over the years.You can see a ship named the Shamrock that went down in 1905 lies helplessly in 12 feet of water ever since.Because of all the wreckage, the waters around Alpena have become one of the few underwater preserves in the U.S. and are a favorite for scuba divers.You can also visit the Jesse Besser Museum (inventor of concrete blocks) to learn about local history and later you can drive over and see his impressive collection of homes that line the coast.About one mile north of town you can take a short one-mile trail in the Besser Natural Area that takes you through a strange looking abandoned village, by a lagoon, and past a thick pine forest.Alpena hosts the Great Lakes Lighthouse festival the second weekend in October (800-4A:PENA).The town of Presque Isle has a museum built into the Old Presque Lighthouse.When you get to Rogers City you may want to take a detour west on Rte. 68 (about 8 miles, watch for signs) to find the Ocqueoc Falls.These are listed as the largest falls in Lower Michigan.Hikers are allowed to take a dip in the pool at the base of the falls.Huron Beach offers a mile long beach that will give you great views of the immense Lake Huron.In the town of Cheboygan you will find some dockside restaurants and may be able to catch a play at the old Oprah house built in 1888. Mackinaw City is the farthest point on Michigan's Lower Peninsula.Because of Mackinaw City's position you can see a sunrise to the east over lake Huron and a sunset to the west over Lake Michigan.The town has built a replica of a fur-trading post and fort that you may want to checkout.This town offers eight championship golf courses. You can't finish this trip without traveling over one of the world's largest suspension bridges that connects Lower Michigan to Upper Michigan - Mighty Mac - at 5 MILES LONG!!!The highlight of you trip will be Mackinac Island (800-454-5227).Here you will have enough to do for an entire vacation ... however, the island's ban on motorized vehicles will allow you to choose alternative means of travel such as one of the islands many horse drawn carriages.On the island you can ride bikes, roller-blade or simply walk to its many Victorian Inns and many craft and art stores.You may want to tour the reconstructed Fort Mackinac that represents a 19th century British fort.

Up the road on the border you will find one of the most beautiful parks along the way - Tishomingo Sate Park. The park consists of 1,500 acres that include the farthest reaches of the Appalachian Mountains, bluffs and tranquil waterfalls. In Tennessee you may want to visit David Crockett State Park and hike or fish or see the Crockett Falls. You may also want to visit the Meriwether Lewis site for camping, hiking, and water sports. The site was built in commemoration of the famous partner of the Lewis and Clark expedition team. In Jackson Falls Tennessee you'll find the tomb of renowned president Andrew Jackson.

Chances are you have seen a picture taken of this lake and island in a magazine or on a book cover. A helpless looking little island with its few trees sits in the middle of Wild Goose Lake and is surrounded by giant mountain peaks. You may want to try to time your photo for a sunrise or sunset here.There are many short hiking trails (between 1 to 3 miles) at the various pullout areas such as Sun Point, St. Mary Falls (a fantastic looking cascading mountain waterfall), and Virginia Falls.You will drive along a section known as Logan Pass and notice that next to the road are some sheer cliffs that demand you keep track of the road despite the magnetic scenery. A waterfall will actually come down off the uphill side and flow down onto the river and over the edge ... don't go with it over the edge with it! The pass is known for its patches of wildflowers and mountain peaks. Shortly after this you will want to stop at the visitor center and may even want to take a short 1.5 mile hike on the boardwalk-covered trail to the Hidden Lake Overlook.The Garden Wall is a length of rocky cliffs that rise 1,000 feet and make up part of the continental divide. From here you will see an area that suffered from a 1967 lightning caused forest fire that scorched the area. After over thirty years the area is just recovering with young trees and shrubs.At the Trail of Cedars you can you can walk along an elevated board walk through an ancient forest and see the blanket of alpine mosses and ferns that cover the forest floor.Towards the end of the route, you may want to consider staying at the impressive Lake McDonald Lodge (602-207-6000). This is a famous rustic looking yet prestigious lodge that has a huge stone and log lobby complete with large dinning room. This is considered the 'Ritz in the Rockies.'The end of the drive takes you into West Glacier, MT ... a town that has a lot of tourist traps (restaruants, gift shops, gas stations). ... A couple of tourist attractions that you really should check out are as follows: - Head west on Hwy 2 about 13 miles and you'll see the \\\"House of Mystery\\\" on the right ... its a place where supposedly there is some vortex (whatever that is) that causes things like marbles to role up hill and brooms to stand on their own. I saw that and more with my own eyes and I can't explain it but it was real. - Down the road there is a place with a huge wooden maze for humans to try to get through - Also, the town of Whitefish has a great lake with public beach if you want to hang out and enjoy a swim scenes like this are everywhere you look Photo contributed by visitor in Mar 09 - \\\"Taken at the parking lot of Logan Pass in September 2008.

These are natural rock structures that served as one of the few natural trail markers in the parries.- You've got to see Chimney Rock ... actually you won't be able to miss this 500 ft column of rock rising strangely by itself in the Nebraska plains.

It's easy to see why this valley has been a desirable place to live for thousands of years.A little farther, you will see a sign marking the Continental Divide National Scenic Trail, a primitive hiking trail. The loop made by the Trail of the Mountain Spirits crosses the Continental Divide Trail twice, accessing a 14-mile-long segment through forested country that is a visual feast of butterflies, birds, and wildflowers. Combine hiking and birding on a new trail created by the New Mexico Audubon Council. At eight designated stops along the Byway, you can look for some of the 337 species of birds which frequent the area.Continue to Lake Roberts, an oasis for the creatures of the wilderness. It's common to see herds of deer grazing along the road near the lake. Past the lake, turn right on NM 15. Nineteen miles on a mountain road take you to Gila Cliff Dwellings National Monument. Although small next to Bandelier National Monument or Mesa Verde National Park, it doesn't suffer in comparison. The beauty of the setting and the few visitors you will encounter make this destination well worth the drive.The route ends in the old mining community of Pinos Altos. Gold was discovered here in 1860, and many of the buildings from that era are still standing.

The town is also home to a very old Spanish Missionary pueblo and church that has become a state monument. Also, if you stop here, be sure and see the 'Soda Dam.' This is a dam made by nature that stands about 40 feet tall and has been built over the years by rock deposits. It continues to grow today and actually chokes off part of the Jemez River.You will love when you reach the 'Valle Grande' area. The scenery just opens up and gives you a great view. Apparently this area was actually at one time a huge volcanic mountain that erupted and then later collapsed creating the valley.The Bandelier National Monument is a neat place to see some ancient Indian cliff dwellings. These dwellings were inhabited by the remarkable Anasazi Indians thousands of years ago. You can visit the nearby visitor center to learn about the history and culture of these ancient Americans or personally walk around in the dwellings.Not far off the route, on Rte 501, is the famous Los Alamos nuclear development center that during World War II developed the Atom Bomb. This town has a museum that will tell you all about the history of the development of the A-bomb and how this has impacted the entire world. The town also has a lot to offer in terms of other tourist attractions.The White Rock overlook is placed next to a 700-foot cliff to give you an awesome view of the Rio Grande Valley.If you take a detour off of Rte. 30 on to 565, you can travel to the Puye Cliff Dwellings and see more of the Anasazi Indian's ancient structures. One of the structures housed about 700 people at one point. The cliff dwellings here are easier to get to than the ones at Bandelier National Monument. Rte. 84 heading north is where you will see some of the most colorful southwestern landscapes in New Mexico.

A stop at the Tiki Bar is a local bikers favorite destination. The restaurants along this stretch of road offer great local seafood and outdoor dining.After crossing the drawbridge the road changes to West Shore Road in Oyster Bay. The road hugs the Long Island Sound where you can admire the beautiful boats moored in Oyster Bay Harbor or take a right along any side street and be treated to the sights of F. Scott Fitzgerald's literary setting. Once in the Town of Oyster Bay, you are in a great walking town where you can stroll while eating the local Pizza, eat a New York bagel, have some ice cream or try a slice of Long Islands famous Italian Pizza. Back on the bikes heading east, visiting Teddy Roosevelt's House at Sagamore Hill is a well worthwhile side trip. After several miles traveling south on Oyster Bay road, you turn east on Northern Boulevard, more commonly referred to as 25A. This stretch of road meanders through the towns of Cold Spring Harbor and Huntington. Huntington is known as Long Island's best village. Again, you can eat any type of ethnic food ranging from Sushi, to Indian, Chinese, American, Indian, Italian, or Greek. From the center of town, you travel north along West Neck Road, through the town of Lloyd Harbor to Caumset State Park. Once again you are riding along the Long Island Sound through areas reminiscent of The Great Gatsby. At the end of the road is Target Rock, a large Boulder perched at the entrance of Huntington Harbor which was once used for target practice by the British Navy. Target Rock has a lovely hike to the water and a small rest stop with bathrooms. Once back on 25A, travel east to the town of Centerport where a small shanty type structure called the Shack awaits the hungry biker. From Spring until Autumn, this is a major stomping ground for Long Island bikers. Most of the bikers, however, tend to be dentists, lawyers, doctors, and accountants out for a little motorcycle therapy and a cold drink.The trip offers the rider an opportunity to take just about any side road and be treated to well paved two lane roads meandering through lovely estates. Travel north from anywhere off 25A and you will be surrounded by lovely homes with lavishly landscaped properties. Also, try visiting the towns of Northport or Stony Brook on your way to Port Jefferson. This nautical village is home of the Ferry to Connecticut and is another favorite biker destination.

It's Funny Cide Ale in Sackets Harbor, home of the six high school buddies who own part of the Kentucky Derby winner. In Clayton, try River Rat Cheese. You can overnight at campgrounds, B&Bs or motels/hotels. Three of the Trail's 28 lighthouses offer overnights, but you better call ahead for reservations. When you want to park the bike and hike, there are wildlife areas, State Parks, and everything from 1000 Islands boat tours and castles to Niagara Falls, historic architecture, world-class fishing, War of 1812 history... Something for everyone besides a great ride.\", \"state_prop_rank\": 0.25806451612903225, \"sinuosity\": 1.2553314779035951, \"route_length\": 399.6286219550417, \"loc_lat\": 43.40947458666944, \"loc_lon\": -77.37565739049451}, {\"gpx_file_num\": 35076, \"name\": \"Catskill Preserve\", \"state\": \"New York\", \"user_rating\": 4.5, \"num_user_reviews\": 14, \"num_users_rode\": 96, \"num_users_want2ride\": 21, \"scenery_rating\": 5, \"drive_enjoyment_rating\": 4, \"tourism_rating\": 4, \"state_rank\": 2, \"num_state_routes\": 62, \"scenery_description\": \"The scenery is spectacular.

This route covers the gorgeous Hudson River Valley crossing many impressive bridges along the way and hugging the river for the most part. The route starts out in New York City and immediately gets you out of the urban jungle by heading west on Interstate 95 across the George Washington Bridge. The bridge itself is something to see. It spans 3,500 ft across the Hudson River. Then you travel along the wall of cliffs known as the Palisades that follow the Hudson River. The road is called the Palisades Parkway and is a favorite bike road in New York. If you take exit 1 to the Englewood Boat Basin or Exit 2 to the Alpine Boat Basin you can enjoy some picnic areas. Just past Exit 2 MAKE SURE YOU take the off ramp to the State Line Lookout. You'll get a GREAT view of the river from up there. Continuing up the Parkway towards Bear Mountain the route gets prettier and prettier. Don't miss this route in the fall!!! The rest of the route specializes in riverside drives (many of the drives are positioned along the side of bluffs overlooking the river) and historic and interesting towns.

Make sure you take the road to the mountain's summit for another great view. To get there take exit 19 to the Seven Lakes Drive and then take the Perkins Memorial drive to the mountain top and start taking photos when you get up there. Harriman State Park is very large and offers all the stuff you'd expect from a top quality state park.Get back on the Palisade Pkwy heading east (turns into Rte. 6) and cross the Hudson over the beautiful Bear Mountain Bridge then turn north on the Bear Mountain-Beacon Hwy (Rte. 9D). Two and a half miles later you'll be going through a place called Manitoga (914-424-3812). This is 80-acres of destroyed land that was purchased by a rich man back in the 1940s and he spent the next 30 years restoring it. Today it's a beautiful garden of nature trails and forests that you can explore. It's a great example of what man can do to restore destroyed land. The Manitoga nature center is open for visitors and is a very interesting stop you all should consider. Click here to read more about this ecological success story.As you approach the town of Cold Spring you will pass some historic riverside mansions. The town of Cold Spring is a pretty little riverside town where you can get off the bike and grab a bite to eat and checkout the town. There is a public gazebo where you can take in the river scenery.Rte. 9D really hugs the river at times heading north out of Cold Spring. Take it all the way till you get to I-84 and take I-84 back west over the Hudson. Take the very next exit, exit-10 south on Rte. 9W for about 5 miles. Look for Rte. 218 heading southeast to both Storm King State Park and the famous West Point Military Academy. This is where the driving gets fun for a little while!!! 218 becomes the 'Storm King Highway' and goes through Storm King State Park. This is one of the best parts of the entire route as the road is carved into a cliff at points hanging over the Hudson River. A lot of twists and turns here - perfect for those of us choosing two-wheels over four. When you get through the park you'll be tempted to turn-around and go through that part of the route again - go for it! If you want to see West Point Military Academy watch for signs or better yet ask a local. West Point has plenty to offer visitors - great tours, an interesting museum and a gift shop. The trick after you leave the military academy is to get to Main Street and head south (this is the slower yet prettier alternative to getting back on 9W south). The road will 'turn into' 218 again and you will have some pretty riverside driving. Then it will merge with 9W and you need to get on 9W and take it south.Take 9W till you get to back to the Palisade Pkwy where you want to head east once again over the Bear Mountain Bridge. Now instead of going northeast like you did before, you want to veer to the right and take 'Bear Mountain Bridge Road' (NOT Bear Mountain-Beacon Hwy).Take Bear Mountain Bridge Road south just about 3-miles and you'll see signs for Peekskill NY and Rte. 202. You cross a bridge (Lower South St) and hit 202 which eventually turns into Rte. 9 or the Briarcliff Peekskill Pkwy. Take this south till the end of the route. Along this section of the route you'll want to pay attention to some of the impressive homes and mansions you'll see. The town of Tarrytown has some historic estates owned by famous people. The famous homeowners that I remember was the guy that wrote 'Rip Van Winkle' and the 'Legend of Sleepy Hollow.'

Hood (Oregon's highest peak), through the Mount Hood National Forest and along the mighty Columbia River.  This route offers not only incredible scenery but also a wide variety of activities and a large number of historical points of interest based on its Lewis and Clark and Oregon Trail connections.  It is one of the 25 elite \\\"All-American Roads\\\" designated by the US Dept. of Transportation and is described in the Reader's Digest guide to the Most Scenic Drives in America. On this route you start out by driving through the Mt Hood National Forest that consist of over a million acres of fertile mountain forests.  There you may see a variety of animals such as bears or mountain cats and see beautiful displays of waterfalls and wildflowers.  You will also make your way through different mountain passes and have many fantastic photo opportunities to catch the majesty of 11,235 ft dormant volcano Mount Hood, Oregon's highest point.  Next the focus of you attention will turn to the rivers and canyons along the way.  You will see the Hood, Salmon and Columbia rivers and the canyons that some of them have carved.  You may even be able to observe the recent growth of windsurfers working their way across the Columbia.  You will see historical buildings in the town of The Dalles and travel some of the same areas as Lewis and Clark did when the arrived in the area around 1805.  Along the Columbia, near the Bonneville Dam you will see a series of fish ladders that Salmon use to leap up and back to the waters where they were hatched.  These Salmon are returning from as far as Alaska to spawn in their native waters.\\r\\n\\r\\nMcR user \\\"JTV69\\\" added the following guidance in Aug of 2021:  The road starts at Exit 69 off I-84, and runs east to The Dalles, where it turns into the main business drag through town.  In the beginning you're at river level on the Mighty Columbia, and within 10 miles you're at the top of the Gorge looking down into valleys and across canyons and old farms that look much as they must have 150 years ago.  There are farms on the way up, and at the top there is a lookout with restrooms and incredible vistas, where you can't see or hear the freeway below, and you can look out to the river.  When you leave the pullout, you start the really fun part of the ride - the next 10 miles are twisties taking you back down the cliff.  There is a good chance you'll see deer, but don't get distracted because the road is technical here.  \", \"drive_enjoyment_description\": \"The roads along this route are outstanding for motorcycles because of the mountains and rivers they tend to follow.

This section offers some real 'driving excitement' for those of you who love when the road gets really twisted up. Also make sure you remember to exit I-84 and get on Rte 30 again at exit 35. This will take you to and past the Ainsworth State Park to the very end of the route.\\r\\n\\r\\nMcR user \\\"JTV69\\\" added the following guidance in Aug of 2021:  The road is in good condition and is well-maintained.  This is a great side trip if you're heading east-west on I-84 and want a change of pace.  The Mosier side is less technical - though still plenty curvy - and has a more gradual elevation change.  The Dalles' side is steeper and with many more turns.  It's one of my favorite short rides in Oregon or Washington.\", \"tourism_description\": \"At the start of your trip you will want to checkout the Mount Hood Info center that you will find on US 26 about 15 miles after passing the town of Sandy. Next you will be able to stop at the Wildwood Recreation Site for hiking along its many trails. Two miles up the road the Zig Zag Ranger Station offers Rhododendron Gardens that will show you the plants that are found blanketing much of the grounds of the northwestern Pacific mountain forests. You will also pass a few key points along the historic Oregon trail that are interesting to see and try to think back to the struggles the pioneers must have had traversing such a hazardous part of the country. Make sure and check out the Timberline Lodge. You'll have to watch for the signs and take a 6-mile detour to the North of Rte 26. Here you will see the Timberline Lodge built by the WPA during the Great Depression at the base of Mount Hood. In addition to the impressive structure you will find a series of hiking trails that meander through the fields of flowers or you can take a chairlift up onto Mount Hood. As you continue along the route you will travel towards the Columbia River (now on Rte 35, see directions/map below) and getting closer to I-84 make sure you stop at Panorama Point and take in one of the best views of the entire route. At the town of Hood River you can take the Mount Hood Railroad on a scenic 44-mile journey through the Hood River valley. When you get to the Cascade locks you can take the bridge that crosses the Columbia into Washington state or climb onboard the Columbia George. This boat is a 'stern-wheeler' that travels the river throughout the summer. Further up the route you will want to stop and see the 620 ft Maltnomah Falls ... bring plenty of film for this part. Next you need to stop at Crown Point State Park and take in the incredible views this park offers from it unique vantage point upon a immense volcanic rock.

It requires a short visit, a cup of coffee in the diner, a walk in the square, and a chat with passers by to find the proud, hardworking communities that still exist. These are communities whose labor fueled the industrialization of this nation - Mining towns that were populated by immigrants from all regions of Europe. And judging by the long lists of names on monuments in each town square, these are patriotic communities who sacrificed dearly to support their new country, all the way back to the Civil War. Travel across Pennsylvania's portion of the Grand Army of the Republic Highway for an excellent ride, not just because of the long sweeps and turns as it crosses the state, but because this historical highway offers a chance to rediscover a time gone by. Eat in 1930's diners, walk on the famous Kinzua Trestle bridge, ride a steam train, descend into a coal mine, and above all, meet a proud people with stories to tell--All on Pennsylvania's Grand Army of the Republic Highway.  Photo submitted by visitor in May 09 - \\\"Kinzua Dam\\\"\", \"drive_enjoyment_description\": \"Leaving the eastern Pennsylvania town of Milford, you will begin to climb a long, winding road out of the Delaware River Valley. You will soon be treated to a series of sweeps and winds as the two-lane road crosses the first of many hills and ridges along the route. Heading west, the Grand Army of the Republic Highway begins to wind its way through hardwood forests, past small lakes, typical of the glacier worn Pocono Mountains. Ages ago, grinding glacial ice smoothed the once rugged peaks, partially filling the valleys. The result is a highway that trades large differences in elevation for a road that continually rises and falls, and turns in long flowing sweeps--A delight for any motorcyclist. Gearing down near Carbondale, a decision has to be made--take the new Route 6 expressway along the ridge above the town, or follow the original highway down into the valley. The expressway by-passes Carbondale and several other small towns. It has a pull-off that provides a panoramic view of the valley, including a small mining operation below. If you opt for the valley ride, a quick right turn will put you on Business 6, which immediately starts a long descent. It soon becomes obvious why numerous signs warn truckers to choose the expressway. After Route 6 passes to the north of the city of Scranton, the road slowly climbs towards the town of Clarks Summit. Before long, it road changes direction and descends into the Susquehanna River Valley. For forty miles, Route 6 stays with the river, rising and falling as it follows the hillsides to the north. The Susquehanna can be seen below winding its way across Pennsylvania?a swift moving, shallow, and generally un-navigable stream. As you follow the river, at times the highway leaves its side to climb a series of five long grades. Fortunately, each grade has a passing lane, so getting around those heavily laden lumber trucks and other freight haulers is quickly accomplished. After the town of Wellsboro, you will be surrounded by dense woodland as you pass through the Allegheny National Forest. Eventually you will come back to civilization as you descend the Allegheny Plateau near the village of Sheffield. We are not yet out of the mountains. U.S. Route 6 now winds its way through a series of valleys, following the Allegheny River and its tributaries. Nine miles west of Union City, U.S. Route 6 joins with Route 19, and heads south to Meadville.. South of Saegertown, traffic increases and the highway becomes four lanes. It soon joins with Route 322 as it becomes a commuter highway. Near Conneaut Lake, U.S. Route 6 leaves Route 322 and once again becomes a two-lane country road. It travels northwest, winding around the Pymatuning Reservoir to the small village of Pennline, the last Pennsylvania town along U.S. Route 6.  Photo submitted by visitor in May 09 - \\\"Sweden Valley Inn\\\"\", \"tourism_description\": \"Visit the old coal mining towns of Honesdale and Carbondale then take a small detour to Scranton. Route 6 approaches the northern edge of the city. A short side visit down Route 11 will offer you two world-class attractions, Steamtown and the Lackawanna Coal Mine. A National Historic Site, Steamtown is operated by the National Park Service. It houses numerous steam locomotives and includes an operating roundhouse where these steam giants are restored. Visit the museum, tour the restorations in progress (it's loud), and ride on a steam train. Nearby is the Lackawanna Coal Mine. Descend 300 feet into this anthracite mine to explore first-hand the hard lives of the deep shaft miners who toiled daily in what can only be described as grim conditions. For more information on the lives of these immigrant miners who came from 36 ethnic groups, you can also stop by the Pennsylvania Anthracite Museum while in Scranton. Much of Wellsboro could easily pass for a well-kept 1930s town. Its picturesque Main Street includes a park-like median, complete with gaslights. Eat at the famous Wellsboro Diner. A porcelain-shelled beauty, it's an excellent example of the diners of the '30s, transported, in pieces, to its current location in 1939--it's cash only. Just eleven miles out of Wellsboro on Route 660, is one of the most beautiful views in the area - the spectacular Pine Creek Gorge, better known as The Grand Canyon of Pennsylvania. Created by glacial action over 10,000 years ago, the gorge is 47 miles long and drops almost 1500 feet at its deepest point. The Pennsylvania Lumber Museum is located along Route 6 near Galeton. It includes a number of restored buildings that replicate a lumber camp of the 1800s. In this area of Pennsylvania, the lumbering of white pine and hemlock was a major industry that rivaled coal mining. Smethport, \\\"Home of the Hubberburger.\\\" We can't pass that by. A stop for lunch at the old Smethport Diner. The diner is an old roadside eatery, similar to Wellsboro's Sterling Diner, except that the years have not been as kind to it. Turn right at Mount Jewett and travel slowly down a heavily patched road, heading for the famous Kinzu Bridge. It's just a twelve-mile detour from U.S. Route 6, but well worth the time. The Kinzu Railroad Viaduct was originally built in 1882 to ship bituminous coal across the Kinzu River Valley, north to New York. Rebuilt in 1900, the bridge is over 300 feet high and 2053 feet long. For many years, it held the record as the highest and longest railroad bridge in the world. Once listed as the Eighth Wonder of the World, the viaduct is still on the National Register of Historic Places and has been designated a National Historic Civil Engineering Landmark.\", \"state_prop_rank\": 0.012987012987012988, \"sinuosity\": 1.1282265155527718, \"route_length\": 399.93086026399163, \"loc_lat\": 41.72534704894295, \"loc_lon\": -77.66170492473935}, {\"gpx_file_num\": 35155, \"name\": \"The Loop\", \"state\": \"Delaware\", \"user_rating\": 3.5, \"num_user_reviews\": 19, \"num_users_rode\": 10, \"num_users_want2ride\": 6, \"scenery_rating\": 4, \"drive_enjoyment_rating\": 3, \"tourism_rating\": 4, \"state_rank\": 1, \"num_state_routes\": 8, \"scenery_description\": \"The loop is a favorite of local sport bikers and riders who want some challenge.

At times you will ride beside shear rock walls, and at others you will ride along a railroad bed that has been converted into a 62 mile bike/hiking path. The park offers lots of fishing, hiking, biking swimming and picnicking opportunities and on a nice day you will see people enjoying all of these activities along the way. You will see many mountains and valleys as you wind you way through the valleys. Lots of trees, streams, mountains, trails, a recreation areas are what you will see.Rolling Hills of Farmland https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pennsylvania_Route_414 For approximately 300 miles outside of the Tidaghton, you will travel along rolling hills of farmland as you twist an turn along what once was a cow path that connected farm to farm. Along this stretch you will see far and wide as you travel along the roller-coaster ride offered-up by PA414.The End of the World! https://www.dcnr.state.pa.us/stateparks/parks/worldsend.aspx Worlds End State Park is in a narrow S-shaped valley of the Loyalsock Creek just south of Forksville, Sullivan County. The scenery is spectacular, especially the June mountain laurel and fall foliage. Canyon Vista, reached via Mineral Spring and Cold Run roads, provides outstanding views. Loyalsock Creek is stocked with trout each year by the Pennsylvania Fish and Boat Commission. The cold mountain water provides good fishing most of the year.\", \"drive_enjoyment_description\": \"This route offers equal parts twists, turns, sweepers, hills, a few straight-aways but not many. The conditions very greatly as PA414 particularly is really a patchwork of many different roads - it offers an ever changing environment to master.As you pass through the Tidaghton State forest the road conditions vary from good to dreadful. There is about a 20 mile stretch from Hillborn (just a place on the map) to Morris that is in a state of complete disrepair - it's only slightly better than a gravel road. You will need to slow down and just navigate through this narrow, pot-hole infested section and just accept it as part of the adventure! Once you cross US15 conditions improve a bit, but much of the road is full of \\\"tar snakes\\\" and bumpy patches here and there. You wont set any speed records or challenge very many of the tight corners on PA414 - just take-it easy and enjoy the scenery and focus on navigating you way through!As you pick-up PA154, road conditions improve as you head further south. PA 154 is full of tight turns and elevation changes with good to fair pavement quality above PA 87 in Forksville. Below PA 87, you will find no better motorcycle road than PA 154. If God made a road to reward the righteous motorcycle enthusiasts - it would be the 10 miles of PA 154 between Forksville and US 220! This section weaves through Worlds End State Park - you will enjoy perfect road conditions as you carve-up some of the best sweepers and corners anywhere in the state. In fact - this section is so good you may want to turn-around and hit it again and again! As if this wasn't enough - the scenery of the forest and the Loyalsock creek also fabulous on this stretch of road.On the way back to Williamsport you will pick-up US 220 - which is a great piece of super-slab highway. You will do some serious descending as you get closer to Williamsport - great road conditions and some nice wide-open sweeper action can be had on this stretch of US220.\", \"tourism_description\": \"Williamsport offers every amenity you would need.

The roads are in generally good condition and you will be rewarded if you take some side trips to try to find your own routes.\", \"tourism_description\": \"One of the first man-made sites you'll find along this route is a home built by the famous architect Frank Lloyd Wright that literally (yes, literally) hangs over a rushing river. You can take a tour of the home and actually hear the rushing water below some of the floors of the house.If you love whitewater rivers and thick woods then you need to plan to spend some time at the Ohiopyle State Park off of state road 381. The Youghiogheny River is an Indian word meaning 'white frothy water' ... you will quickly see why the name fits the river so well. The park has a section of the river that passes through a huge gorge. There are plenty of overlooks for you to see the river if you stop and walk around in the park. The park is loaded with trails.Youghiogheny Lake offers fishing, hiking and camping for those interested.Laurel Hill State Park is a top quality park that has a visitor's center that can tell you about all the trails and attractions the park has to offer.In the town of Somerset you can has a large Historical Center where old pioneer-like skills and crafts are on display. Here you can also pickup a brochure and a nearby Covered Bridge Route that may become the favorite part of this route for you.Take US 31 east to the town of Manns Choice where the route can get a little tricky as you head to Bedford ... don't hesitate to ask for directions if you think your lost.The town of Bedford dates back to before the declaration of independence and was the location where George Washington once established a headquarters. The town offers a walking tour that will tell you all about the role this town played as a frontier outpost. If you want to visit a recreated Colonial settlement, visit the Old Bedford Village.On route 30 heading east you will see some Inns and taverns from as long ago as the 1700s. Some are even strategically built 4 miles apart because that was the average daily travel length for people that day.If you take a detour off of US 30, south on state road 96, you can go to the Shawnee State Park.At Bald Knob summit you can take in some views of both Maryland and West Virginia.The route finishes up in the nice little town of Ligonier. Here you can walk or drive down Main street and checkout the beautiful historic buildings.Laurel Hills Visitors Bureau (800-925-7669).\", \"state_prop_rank\": 0.22077922077922077, \"sinuosity\": 2.4005586209829097, \"route_length\": 161.03314417220523, \"loc_lat\": 39.99987232181852, \"loc_lon\": -79.07289407332165}, {\"gpx_file_num\": 35171, \"name\": \"Lincoln Highway\", \"state\": \"Pennsylvania\", \"user_rating\": 4.3, \"num_user_reviews\": 33, \"num_users_rode\": 41, \"num_users_want2ride\": 15, \"scenery_rating\": 5, \"drive_enjoyment_rating\": 5, \"tourism_rating\": 1, \"state_rank\": 3, \"num_state_routes\": 77, \"scenery_description\": \"I couldn't believe that US 30 wasn't on MotorcycleRoads.com.

Whites Diner is BBQ and soul food in a very relaxed setting, served up from a buffet, meat and 2 style with the world's best cornbread...lunch only on weekdays. (Yes, he's a real sergeant, retired from the USMC.) Read the NY Times article. - The Blackstone cafe is breakfastlunch 7 days each week. Breakfast is Low Country style with shrimp and grits, eggs Benedict with piles of crabmeat and huge muffins and cinnamon rolls.One of America's finest national cemeteries is located in Beaufort. A South Carolina Medal of Honor winner, Civil War heroes, The Great Santini and many more of America's finest are laid to rest here under sprawling old oak trees. If you know a Marine, he's likely to remember Beaufort as Parris Island, a basic training post for the USMC is located here. A Marine Corps Air Station often is host to air shows and other displays. The Beaufort National Cemetery was designed by and authorized by President Abraham Lincoln. The layout is a half-wheel configuration with \\\"spokes\\\" leading out to grave sites. The cemetery is the resting place for heroes such as Medal of Honor winner Ralph H Johnson, The Great Santini, Union Soldiers of the all Black Massachusetts 55th Infantry, more than 7,500 Civil War soldiers and others up to and including modern day conflicts such as the current war. During events like Veterans Day, motorcycles are guided by uniformed Marines from nearby Parris Island to reserved parking spots for the convenience of the riders. It isn't often you'll get that sort of service and respect and although those special ceremonies can be a bit crowded, it's worth arriving a bit early to watch the color guards and listen to local dignitaries and members of our military as they honor those fallen.Hunting Island State Park is our frequent destination. A small fee gets you in to a primitive park that has an extensive network of well paved roads, picnic facilities, restrooms, plenty of places to fish and a wide expanse of beach to enjoy. It's motorcycle friendly and safe with regular patrols by rangers who are always happy to stop and talk. Cabins are available to rent, there's a large camping facility and as part of the park, a pier is available for fishing or just relaxing and taking in the view.

West of Gaffney you will come to the Cowpens National Battlefield where the underdog American colonists staged an upset victory over the British in 1781.If you're into history, don't pass the walking tour offered here. Next you'll need to head to Caesars Head State Park by taking US 276 north.Caesar's Head is one of the most beautiful state parks in all of South Carolina with breathtaking views.The road leading to the park will also give you fantastic views of the surrounding Blue Ridge foothills.The park and local area have over 50 waterfalls.If you take a tough 2 mile hike on a trail in the park to Raven Cliff Falls you'll get to see this fall dive about 400 feet through a gorge. Table Rock State Park is named after the solid granite flat top mountain that according to the Indians was the place where the Great Spirit dined.It is also home of one of lodge built by the depression-era Works Project Administration.It is another fantastic park with plenty of hiking trails, some leading to the summit of the mountain.Near Table Rock you'll find a place called Aunt Sue's Country Corner that looks like an old pioneer village selling odd little crafts and offering places to eat. Keowee-Toxaway State Park - the park has a nice museum and a great 'Interpretive Center/Trail' that tells you about the history of the Indians both before and after Europeans entered the area. Devils Fork State Park - take Rte. 25 north to visit this great park situated right next to the huge Lake Jocassee. Rte. 107 is an official Scenic Byway that travels through the Sumter National Forest.From this section you will see even more impressive mountains and lush thick forests.The Chattooga River is known as one of the best whitewater rafting rivers in the US.If your in to that kind of thing, you will be able to find many companies that provide raft adventure trips in this area. Towards the end of Rte. 107 when it meets with Rte. 28, look for signs directing you to the Stump-house Tunnel Park.In this park you'll find a huge 200-foot waterfall.

Ten days with temp of 85 to 105 degrees. This is a great road to relax on. Stop at pull outs and take a refreshing swim in the Colorado River to cool off. Too many roads so little time, but I'll remember this one forever.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\n42 Miles of canyon road that follows the upper Colorado River. Road twists as much as the famous river. This road is near the world famous Arches National Park.\\r\\n\\r\\nIn August of 2013, MotorcycleRoads.com excellent contributor \\\"GJRonK\\\" added the following: \\\"Unbelievable extremes of colors form the tapestry of rock along this route. The first 15 miles are narrow canyon walls, some 1,500' high, that surround you and guide you along the narrow two lane road sharing the bottomland with the river. The views of the river become varied as parts of the roadway is on shelf roads. Occasional small canyons squeeze in from the sides, now and then, with some beckoning hiking trails up through the rock cuts in the sides.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou will see various boaters using the river for water adventure. Pullouts for viewing are every mile, or so, but are usually graveled. There are also numerous campgrounds with picnic tables and pit toilets along the way. The river is often dark tan from runoff high in the Rockies. During high water, it can come right up to the roadway.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt mm14 is the Red Cliffs Guest Ranch, which is first class. You can stop for a free visit to the movie memorabilia museum. At this point, the canyon widens out to show distant ridges that can be dark red or purple. Here, the road is some distance from the river for a while. You will pass country used countless times in movies. (Note: The last one I personally saw here was filming for Geronimo: An American Legend in 1992.) \\r\\n\\r\\nAs the road runs alongside the river again, the walls remain the same type--various layers of sedimentary rock, although all the rock this side of Moab is younger than that to the west of the Moab Fault line. You'll approach the old settlement of Dewey Bridge, with only one building left. The historic bridge has burned down, but you can stop on the south side and see the remnants and read some about it. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs you proceed north, you will pass several pullouts with some Indian rock etching called petroglyphs. Look high up onto some darker, smooth surface rock on the left side of the road.\\r\\n\\r\\nIf you choose to pass alongside Cisco, you will see a town that civilization doesn't seem to need anymore. Founded in 1883, it was a rail watering stop, then a large wool shipping station, then oil was the big driver, then mining. Along around 1970, as the freeway even bypassed the town, there was little to keep residents around. Now there are maybe 5 residents left.\\\"\\r\\n\\r\\nFightclubTX added on 2020-10-17: \\\"The river canyon is stunning. Especially early in the morning as the sun rises behind you and lights the walls of the canyon. \\r\\n The Cisco ghost town is pretty cool as well. It is unsettling. :)\\\"\", \"drive_enjoyment_description\": \"Road is at the 4000 ft elevation with good two lane blacktop.

Turns are usually wide, but a few third gear blind ones. There are many tar snakes along here.

The scenic town of Newfane is your first drive through leading you to Townsend, there are several antiques dealers on this stretch of Rt. 30. In Townsend you will take Rt. 35 (to a left on Grafton Road to the town of Grafton) up through Grafton (where you will make a Left on 35 to Chester). The town of Grafton has a covered bridge and a small scale cheese factory, blacksmith shop and a sheep farming operation admission is free of charge. Chester Depot is a nice place to stop and have a coffee in Country Girl Diner on 103/11, sorry no Starbucks.Driving through Ludlow and along the Black river is both scenic and exhilarating. Onwards to Rt. 100 south towards the Weston Country Store founded in 1945 dedicated to preserve Vermont's rural integrity, a great place to see the offerings of yester years. Then we drive south to Rt. 11 and west to Manchester where it would be fitting to stop for lunch at any of many restaurants including Mulligan's Restaurant offering a variety of good pub fare.Manchester is also the home of \\\"Hildene\\\" the former estate of Robert Todd Lincoln, the son of President Lincoln.Picnic lunch might be an option here we could meet a group at Hildene or pack brown bag.After lunch we head south on 7A towards Arlington home to the Norman Rockwell museum Admission $3 well worth a visit. Further south we have the town of Bennington where we would ride up to the Bennington Monument, where you may ride the elevator to the 200ft observation deck with fine lookouts. From Bennington we take Rt. 9 east through the hillsides over into Wilmington where those that want can walk the streets of Wilmington for some shop gawking and showing of our rides. The Gray Ghost Inn is only 7.5 miles from this town so if people have had enough they can ride home to relax by the pool.Dinner would be served at the Gray Ghost Inn.\", \"state_prop_rank\": 0.47619047619047616, \"sinuosity\": 1.3070545993896054, \"route_length\": 90.21228487777508, \"loc_lat\": 43.12244902943849, \"loc_lon\": -72.88715368539128}, {\"gpx_file_num\": 35275, \"name\": \"Route 17 - MAD RIVER GLEN\", \"state\": \"Vermont\", \"user_rating\": 3.33, \"num_user_reviews\": 16, \"num_users_rode\": 4, \"num_users_want2ride\": 5, \"scenery_rating\": 5, \"drive_enjoyment_rating\": 4, \"tourism_rating\": 3, \"state_rank\": 1, \"num_state_routes\": 21, \"scenery_description\": \"Beautiful country, mountains everywhere...and the twisties, amazing!

The paving of the road didn't spoil the off road appetite too much, since around the area there are still plenty of tracks to be explored.\\r\\n\\r\\nLess famous than Transfagarasan Road, Transalpina is considered to be the best paved motorcycle road by the local motorcyclists, offering the possibility of some superb motorcycle riding.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe motorcycle riders that have had the pleasure to ride this incredible road consider it even more adventurous than Transfagarasan, which still remains the second highest road in Romania and probably the best in the world. \\r\\n\\r\\nSo there you have it, two dream roads in Romania, connecting other regions of the country with famous Transylvania, two original, perfectly designed dream roads, offering incredible rides and enormous satisfaction for the riders.\\r\\n\\r\\nDare to dream, and dare to make your dream rides come true.\", \"drive_enjoyment_description\": \"New tarmac, 90% paved at the time of this submission (11/14/2011).

This is a trip I took not too long ago that was surpisingly nice (to me.)\\r\\n\\r\\nStarting at Albany, LA on Highway 190 or from Hammond, make your way west on Highway 190 to Albany. Albany seems like a small community right out of the 1960s with buildings out of the 1940s, perhaps. I am very curous about the Pentacostal Church sign at Hwy 190 and 43; it's the biggest sign around these parts. Not much to Albany except a very leisurely 35 MPH speed limit (Observe it! Not much to do in Albany but ticket speeders and go to church, I think!)\\r\\nOnce you get on Highway 43 North, the ride improves 100%. Very nice rolling turns, not too sharp, and shaded sections of road. Careful of some occassional logging and farm traffic along this road. You are near timber-leases and farmland here. \\r\\n\\r\\nTake this road north about 14 miles to near Montpeiler, where you can catch Highway 16 east towards Amite.\\r\\nThe road surface of Hwy 16 is excellent -- you can pick up your pace, and why not? Not much to see but a well-maintained highway with rural pasture land on either side. After about 6.5 miles, you will come to 'civilization' with shopping malls, fast food joints, and I-55 crossing overhead. Don't dispair, don't stop. You are passing this up ...unless you need fuel or want some coffee.\\r\\n\\r\\nGo about one more mile and you arrive in Amite City's downtown area, which has wonderful old buildings, converted train depot that once served the old IC railroad, and some old houses and hardware stores. It begs one to stop for a few minutes after turning left to go north on highway 51, where a roadside parking area is next to the old train depot and a small municipal park.  \\r\\nMurphy's Family Restaurant and Loco Java Coffee and Tea are nearby here, but if you can, wait! A real treat awaits in McComb at the end of this trip.\\r\\n\\r\\nRun north along side the railroad up Highway 51 towards Mississippi. You'll pass Roseland, Fluker, Tangipahoa (the town), and Kentwood, all nice (and very small) communities forcing you to slow down a bit and ponder \\\"what do people do around here.\\\" I think Kentwood produces 1990s child pop singers, but can only recall one named Britney S-omething or other. Anyway, while you can't really see it at this point, you are also running parallel to the Tangipahoa River to your east. You will get closer to it and I'll mention a detour if you actually want to cross it and risk hitting some deer.\\r\\n\\r\\nApproximately 19 miles after leaving Amite is Osyka, Mississippi, and this is where Highway 51 starts undulating with a few hills. The hills get progessively more steep, and you'll actually have to slow down in some spots to be safe about potential traffic on the blind hills. This is true at Osyka and about 3.5 miles north of Osyka at Chatawa (St. Mary drive on your right.) Now here is where you can get a glimpse of some old, rural timber land, farms and St. Mary of the Pines if you care to take a right onto St. Mary Drive towards OLD Highway 51. The Detour is not great in condition but it is paved. It will force you to cross the Tangipahoa River at the Chatawa Post Office (next to the river and in the middle of seemingly NOWHERE.) I don't know what people do here these days except maybe pick up their mail.. hunt and drill for natural gas and oil.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis area is where deer will run along the road and possibly in front of you. Careful! It is curvy and hilly so you'll have to slow down quite a bit. This area was settled by old New Orleans families and eventually the Catholic nuns at St. Mary's back in the 19th and early 20th centuries. It was a refuge from the Yellow Fever epidemics and eventually good timber and crop land. And yes, the Tuscaloosa Marine Shale is tens of thousands of feet underground and evidently capably of producing a lot of natural gas and oil... Back to the ride>\\\\.\\r\\n\\r\\nOLD Highway 51 is reached from this detour using St. Mary Rd, where you'll want to turn left to go north into Magnolia. Old 51 forks at Pleasant Springs Rd. (go Left) then turn left again when that road terminates at Centerville. Centerville joins Highway 48 E (take a left yet again), which takes you right into downtown Magnolia, Mississippi. \\r\\n\\r\\nIf you opted to stay on the Newer Highway 51, it rolls up and down hills right into Magnolia proper. Nice court house. Nice people. Or, breeze up Highway 51 to McComb if you see it is near 11:00 AM. Hwy 51 turns into S. Broadway Street at McComb. Stay on a bit and take a left at 5th Ave for lunch (11:00 AM to 2:00 PM T - Sun) at the Dinner Bell Restaurant. It's real round-table dining with authentic Southern Mississippi food in an older looking home! Huge lazy-susan buffet style feast to enjoy with total strangers.

From Florence, take Hwy 79 due south through virgin unspoiled Sonoran desert. This merges into Hwy 77 and you continue south skirting the western slopes of the Santa Catalina Mt. range of north Tucson. As you enter Tucson, you head east again through the heart of Tucson and reach the base of Mt. Lemmon on the eastern end of town. The sign at the base indicates 30 miles to the top of Mt. lemmon consisting of huge, sweeping curves and breathtaking scenic vistas as you climb from Tucsons 2400ft. above sea level elevation to over 9000ft at the summit. Since it was still early March, we were thankful we had some layers of warm clothing under our leather. The views as you ascended were impressive and it took everything to keep your eyes on the road as you took in the expanding valley below you. We stopped several times, as the view across the San Pedro River Valley to the east was stunning. As you neared the top, the quaint little mountain town of Summerhaven greets you. With a ski slope and lift, this little town does well during the winter months, but inclement weather can close portions of the road going up, if only temporarily. My riding partner and I reached the top and had lunch at a neat little cabin-like restaurant and shared our thoughts and comments on this terrific ride. On our way back to Phoenix we stopped at a roadside memorial on Hwy 79 just south of Florence commemorating cowboy Tom Mix who was killed in a car accident on this very spot. All in all, a really nice little run. With summer temperatures reaching 112 degrees and warmer, the trip down through the desolate desert isnt recommended.

Just past the fuel, you'll find Finger Lakes State Park.  You should explore that when you have time.  This leg terminates at HWY 124 (W), very near Pinnacles Park.

Careful of that pair of \\\"S\\\" turns.  No biggie, but the inexperienced should obey the speed limit through there.  This leg makes the whole ride for many people.

Enjoy the nice set of hills!  Before you know it, you're just outside of Fayette.  Go on into town - you'll find Emmet's there on the square.  My hats off to the chef.\\r\\n\\r\\nState HWY240(E) & State HWY40 from Fayette to Columbia, Mo (~22mi):  Take it easy on this high quality asphalt.  Just follow the signs back to Columbia and relax.  You'll see Agriculture along the way.  Do be careful of our friends working in the field.  Those tractors could be around any corner!  There's a good mix of straight streches, hills, and corners along this route.  Even a novice will not have to fall below the speed limit to negotiate this leg.  Once on 40, you'll quickly cross back over the Moniteau River (now looking more like a river) into Boone County.  A more dramatic bottom land only a few miles from the MIssouri River.

This highway has plenty of twisties to keep your intererst when you are not marveling at the scenery and perhaps seeing some of the abundant wildlife (deer, antelope, elk, coyotes, rabbits).  Near Walden, you enter what is called the North Park of Colorado, a high mountain valley where the North Platte flows from its beginnings in the Colorado Rockies.

This area was so barren at one time that the U.S.Army on one occasion in the late 1800s experimented with using camels for transportation (which is where the camels in the town sign come from). Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, as they say, so on this route one must look at the surroundings for what they are-survivors in harsh climate. As you head south on 95, enjoy the silhouette of the rugged Kofa Mountains to the east and the Chocolate Mountains to the west. The vegetation begins as mostly creosote bushes with scraggly catclaw acacia and ironwood in the dry washes. Interestingly, ironwood is so heavy and dense, it won't float. As you head south, you will gradually, and only occasionally see the giant cactus called the saguaro. You can recognize its telephone pole shape and its arms raised as if in surrender. It's the state cactus of Arizona, and quite amazing. I can be 80' high and weigh several tons. When the occasional rains come, the plant will soak up as much moisture as it can and will slightly \\\"bloat\\\" out.\\r\\nMore of the plants that become more numerous as you head south are the green trunked palo verde tree and the ocotillo. The ocotillo looks like an octopus turned upside down. If you catch it in the spring after several rains, it will have bright flowers blooming on the end of its spiny, vertical branches.\\r\\n\\r\\nSouth of Stone Cabin, and to the west, is the Army Proving Grounds area. You may see troops, or vehicles on training activities. I have seen large tanks booming along the trails just a quarter of a mile off the highway. At mm47, Martinez Lake Road, you may want to turn west if you have just seen any paratroopers dropping from the sky. Their practice landing area is 5 miles up this road.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs you turn west at mm45 towards the entrance to the Imperial Dam (on the Colorado River), you will pass exhibits of tanks and large guns on display. Then you'll pass wetland with tules growing more than 6' high and a lot of tamarisk (which is an imported plant invading most of the waterways of the southwest). Frequently you will see the wild burros that wander around. Keep heading south and west until you get to the groves of date palm trees. They're the ones with the long fronds, as opposed to the fan palm with the fan shaped leaves. If the Imperial Date Farms store is open, stop for a date shake. You'll never forget the taste!\\r\\n\\r\\nStop if you need to in Yuma. This is a pretty large city. It always has been important. Even a hundred years ago, it was the center of trade. Check the article at this link (https://searchwarp.com/swa815458-The-Desert-Lifeline.htm) for some info on this subject. \\r\\n\\r\\nAs you head north on S-34, there is more desert. Along here are more washes and the views get more interesting the further north as the foothills are undulating, have many layers of color in the strata. Along this stretch is a seemingly endless series of roller-coaster hills that is the road. It's fun to ride. There is also more vegetation and farm fields.

You can see the edges of the old basaltic flow of molten rock 500 feet higher than the roadway and sharp drop-offs into an older layer. The vegetation along here shows the lack of rainfall. This section ends at Kirkland, which is no more than a few houses and one bar/restaurant.\\r\\n\\r\\nAs you travel up the stream bottom on the way up Iron Springs Road (Hwy. 10), there is a lovely canyon with broadleaf trees such as cottonwood. They are not so common in the western part of the state. In 7 miles, you'll reach the small community of Skull Valley. There is a cafe, garage, and a small museum here (although it's never been open when I've come by).\\r\\n\\r\\nThe gradual climb up this road gives nice views of the mountains to the north. As you get to about mm19, the trees become more plentiful. (Kirkland is 3,930' elevation, Prescott is 5,400'). There are a number of conifer (cone bearing) trees here such as the pinion pine (a round shape), juniper (a pointed top, small tree) and, on the more shady slopes, ponderosa pine. The ponderosa is tall and quite attractive with its giraffe looking bark and long leaves. \\r\\n\\r\\nYou enter the outskirts of Prescott now, and can find full services. You can return the same way you came, or take Hwy. 89 for different views to the south and a very curvy few miles out of town if you head back down towards Wickenburg (elevation 2,100').\", \"drive_enjoyment_description\": \"Most of the road is in pretty good shape and it's easy to hold a moderate speed as the turns are not often blind or slow. The main problem comes in where older roadway has either tar snakes or has deteriorated into gravel that may accumulate here and there.

Immediately on the California side is the location of Earp, CA, named after the famous lawman, Wyatt Earp. He had many mining claims in this area along with the only permanent home he ever actually owned. None of his stuff is around now, however. \\r\\nAs you proceed along the river, you will see sedimentary rock mostly, left by ancient lakes and streams. This soon turns into more jagged and prominent basalt from old lava flows. Some of these hills go straight up from the roadway. You will have views of the vacation homes along the river, mostly on the Arizona side. The California side is primarily r.v. parks. Along here, wild burros are frequently wandering around. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe spur to Black Meadow Landing is 20 miles of frequent tight turns and amazing views of the jagged rock formations.

To me, that's not ordinary. \\r\\nYou start your trip from ranch land in the lower valley out of Montrose where you will pass through some pinion/juniper forest. Most of these trees are less than 20' high, which is normal for semi-arid land. As you approach the park at about 8300', you come into more Gamble oak and mountain mahogany bushes up to about 10'. This is also the vegetation along the rim.

Back at the top of the canyon wall, you can travel another 10 miles, or so, on around the ridge overlooking the canyon you were just down in.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe river took about 2 million years to cut through the rock as the land kept rising. There is the interesting history of man realizing there was no easy way across this extremely deep canyon, nor an easy way to travel down it or use the water for cultivation either. But the rock is the story. \\r\\n\\r\\nIn the past, the river cut through softer volcanic rock from nearby eruptions that flowed over the area. Then it cut through harder crystalline rock, especially forceful before the upstream dams that are now present. Along the walls are tremendous displays of intrusions, which were formed by hot volcanic magma being forced up through cracks in rock above it. Now they look like colored lines printed on the opposing sheer rock walls.\\r\\n\\r\\nOf course, a stop at the visitor center is a must to see the displays and the short movie on the history of the canyon and descriptions of the animals that are often here.

Generally, Loma is a small farming/ranching town. \\r\\nThis trip has three main attractions, however, the beginning isn't one of them. The first 14 miles are pretty barren desert with little vegetation and poor road surface. Although, as you get across this area, you will have a view of the Book Cliffs, as they are called, since the layers of sedimentary rock could be visualized as a book on its side. The vegetation becomes more attractive with pinion and juniper trees at the lower elevation, changing into Gamble oak and large sage bushes. If you have never ground sage leaves between your fingers and smelled the aroma, then stop along the way and do so.\\r\\n\\r\\nYou'll climb about 4,000' up to the top of Douglas Pass (8,268' at the top) where you will stop to stretch and view to the south. Nice view. Caution: don't let your gloves blow over the side! \\r\\n\\r\\nGoing down is more of the mountainous vegetation. Since this area is dryer than much of the Rockies, there are not many tall conifer trees. The scenery down is quite lovely, but you'll be going slower than any cars. The turns are sneaky, so don't let other drivers rush you. From the top, and much of the route on to Rangely, gives good views of the colorful layers of sedimentary rock. Often these rock walls are right next to the highway.\\r\\n \\r\\nAs you level out somewhat, at about mile marker 53 (mm53), you will be coming into the BLM's designated Canyon Pintado National Historic District. This area was named by Father Escalante in September, 1776, when he first traveled this route with other explorers who were looking for a good route to Monterey, California. They discovered many petroglyphs (rock carvings) and pictographs (rock wall paintings) down along Douglas Canyon.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are marked stops in a half dozen places to view the rock art, but the three easiest to get to are at mm53.5, 56, and 56.5. These are remnants of rock art from the Fremont and Anasazi (from 1,300 to 600 years ago), and more recent Ute Indians. Some of the petroglyphs are thought to be from the Barrier Canyon people of 11,000 years ago.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlong the way there are a few abandoned pioneer cabins and numerous natural gas taps and pumping stations.

Beyond a doubt, one of the most memorable routes we took was when I rode down the west coast.  A great coastal scenic drive stretches for about 511 km (or 318 miles) (in West Coast New Zealand) along an area referred to by some as the \\\"West Coast of the Southern Alps.\\\"  These stretches of roads offer stunning views of the ocean along one side with a backdrop of green hills and mountains on the other side.  \\r\\n\\r\\nStarting out in the north in the town of Karamea you'll see verdant green open farming areas and begin to head south along state highway 67 where the route begins by hugging the coast but soon turns you into the surrounding hills where you will travel through the lush hillsides & valleys.   \\r\\n\\r\\nAs you come through Mokihinui the road brings you back to the coast where the flat peaceful grasslands meet the Tasman Sea (body of the Pacific that lies between NZ and Australia).  As you ride along the coast, you'll occasionally see some marshy wetlands and palm trees dotting the way.  \\r\\n\\r\\nSoon the route takes you more inland again and you pass through Westport.  The whole way you'll find seaside villages like this with modest, well taken care of little houses with colorful sidings like blue, pinks or greens, and colorful green or red roofs, and often with nice flower gardens. \\r\\n\\r\\nNow the topography starts to get more dramatic as the flatter farming lands give way to the steeper hill and cliffs that start to crowd the road. Near Woodpecker Bay, the road and sea nearly meet.  Then the road starts to head up into the hills and you see a lot more cliffs along the mountain-side but soon you are traveling back through seaside towns again.   \\r\\n\\r\\nYou will come up on an area that is called \\\"Glacier Country\\\" named for the presence of  \\\"Franz Joseph\\\" and \\\"Fox\\\" Glaciers.   These vast masses of ice flow from the higher altitudes all the way down to with a couple hundred meters above see level!  I was amazed to learn that glaciers are in such a moderate climate like this ... expecting to see them only in some winter wonderland area.  You can take hiking tours of the glaciers too!   If you have the money, the helicopter tours seemed to be the way to go but we opted for a simple hike to the head of \\\"Franz Joseph Glacier\\\" instead.  \\r\\n\\r\\nAnd, if you like wildlife viewing, seals and we're told certain breads of penguin can be spotted along the coast at different times of the year.  \\r\\n\\r\\nFurther south around Bruce Bay, there are times when the vegetation seems to swallow up the road and you trade views of the coast and mountains for views of lush forests.  \\r\\n\\r\\nSoon you'll pass Lake Paringa and the road will bring you back to the coast with the vegetation staying lush and dominating your surroundings.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThis will be the scenery that takes you to the route's end in the very small town of Haast.\", \"drive_enjoyment_description\": \"This road has a lot of nice variety.  Mostly straight or slow sweeping curves to navigate but there are some sections as you weave between the cliffs and the coast that are nice twisties to go through as well as some sections heading up and down through the hills that offer some nice fun sections of riding.   Particularly there are some nice turns just south of Karamea, south of Charleston as you pass by Woodpecker Bay, and in sections of Glacier County. But overall the road is not much of a challenge and that turns out to be a great thing because you really want to spend more time taking in the sights than worrying about how to handle blind corners or keeping your eyes glued to the road.  The roads conditions are typical for New Zealand in that they are well maintained yet with smaller shoulders than what we are used to riding on in the US.  That's normally not a problem but there are times that we wanted to pull over and take in a view and we felt a little uneasy about not being able to get our bikes further off the road.  It never caused us an issue but it did give us a challenge at times trying to find the best spots to pull over.\", \"tourism_description\": \"There are a number of towns sprinkled along the coast so you're never that far from civilization.  At the start of the route (if you start in the north), Karamea is a smaller town that among other things offers trails for hiking and basic necessities.  \\r\\nAlong the route, a town called Greymouth we visited seemed to be the largest urban area along the path.  The town is the hub for a lot of recreational activities including ATV rentals, bicycle rentals, river rafting, hiking, climbing, and even helicopter rides.  It also has a good collection of art shops and restaurants and lodging.  \\r\\n\\r\\nFor you history lovers out there, there is a recreated pioneer town just south of Greymouth called Shantytown.  It's a throwback village that includes a steam train ride, vintage gold mining era architecture, gold panning, and shops and eateries.\\r\\n\\r\\nNot as large as Greymouth, yet our favorite is a town called Hokitika.  Its a town we stopped and spent some time in and we're glad we did.  It's a magnet for artesian and local artists so if you are into jewelry, sculptures,  paintings or just about any art, you're going to enjoy this stop.

Hwys W, MM, TT and 135 offer lots of quick hills (some steep) and fast, sweeping curves.  Overall, I think the pavement is in good condition.  We didn't encounter any pot hols, but there were some rough places, that were easily maneuvered around.  Be careful on Hwy W, if you are busy sight-seeing, the road can get you.  For me, hwy W was the more challenging of the roads on this route.  This entire route presents lots of places to stop and look, take pictures and generally take in the beauty of the northern ozarks.  You will find lots of fields, trees and plenty of wildlife.

Here you can get fuel or a pop.  If you want to wait, Versailles has a few more options in fuel choices.  There is also a Wal Mart in Versailles, and several places to get a bite to eat.  Once you leave Versailles on Hwy W, you won't encounter a fuel stop until you reach the LOZ area.  When you are at the lake, you will be presented with options on fuel and food.  The folks at the Leather Man store, recommended Wise Guys for lunch.  We ate there, the food was hot and the tea was cold.  Prices were reasonable as well.  There is a mexican restaurant there as well and well as other food shops.  I would recommend fueling up the bike before pressing on.  Once you get onto Hwy 135 you will have to make it to Stover before you see another fuel stop.\", \"state_prop_rank\": 0.1375, \"sinuosity\": 1.3190625445002253, \"route_length\": 57.42492520573706, \"loc_lat\": 38.2936887693822, \"loc_lon\": -92.80669985632932}, {\"gpx_file_num\": 36023, \"name\": \"Deer Creek Canyon\", \"state\": \"Colorado\", \"user_rating\": 4.0, \"num_user_reviews\": 3, \"num_users_rode\": 9, \"num_users_want2ride\": 3, \"scenery_rating\": 5, \"drive_enjoyment_rating\": 3, \"tourism_rating\": 4, \"state_rank\": 34, \"num_state_routes\": 77, \"scenery_description\": \"Starts outside the Rocky Mountains, taking you up a deep valley past beautiful mountain homes and large fields.\", \"drive_enjoyment_description\": \"Lots of sweeping and sharp turns into the mountains with nice curves to keep you entertained the whole way.

You can see it in the plants which are all small leaved with a waxy surface to retard evaporation. The animals restrict their movement to times of cool or at night. \\r\\n\\r\\nSo while you may want to walk along some of the 8 miles of hiking trail, or utilize some of the bicycle trails, you can just walk along the main view point and see a spectacular view. I mean spectacular!  You will be amazed of seeing the meandering Colorado River 2,000' below. You can see a panorama of layers of sedimentary rock displaying their vivid colors as they lay one on top of another.\\r\\n\\r\\nSedimentary rock erodes in a vertical manner, so the multitude of distant cliffs are all laid out with their sheer drops.

Up this wall of solid rock snakes the entry road. Near the top, a pull-off will let you look back at a geologic fault line running up the valley you just left. Everything on the west side is younger rock than anything on your side. \\r\\nFurther progression will take you past amazing views of contorted, eroded, colorful sandstone rock layers. You'll see alcoves, points, domes, walls and even some balanced rocks. You will have a number of places to park to hike or just take photos. (Note: 95% of my photos were taken while sitting on my bike.)\\r\\n\\r\\nThese unbelievable landforms were formed after deep underground salt deposits eroded and shifted allowing the surface rocks to weather in unique ways. The main attraction are the arches of which there are over 2,000 in the park. The number is not fixed as more get discovered and are formed or destroyed by the wind and water continuingly sculpting the rock.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne of the first overlooks is of a wide open area with the La Sal mountains in the background. They are lumpy and jagged on the tops as they were formed by forces pushing up, while this park's rocks were formed by layers under seas and lakes before being eroded from the top. The landform walls here are mostly vertical.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe next stop will be at the Windows Area where there are several arches easily hikable. As you approach this area you will pass Balanced Rock which was in the opening scene in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. On down the main road will take you to a turn that brings you to the parking area for a look at the old Wolf Ranch (used in the late 1800s) and start of the moderately difficult hiking trail up to Delicate Arch (probably the most photographed arch in the world). Unfortunately, no bikes, although you can take the paved road further on to the lower view of the arch with a short walk.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe main road will then take you past more beautiful views and overlooks. A stop at Sand Dune Arch will let you take a real short hike up to one near the road. You will also pass a lot of gnarly juniper trees and dark green pinyon pine, the main trees in the park.\\r\\n\\r\\nLandscape Arch at the end of the road is a 1.6 mile hike out and back, but is the most spectacular in length. At 290', it's the longest natural arch in the world. We used to be able to hike under it, but several slabs have broken off in the last twenty years and the trail is now closed. Don't know how long it will last. One earthquake would doom it. \\r\\n\\r\\nOf course, if you have time and energy, there are many trails out to many arches you could take. But as this is a m.c. site, you can still see a lot by never leaving your bike. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe movies shot here include Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade (1988), Thelma & Louise (1990), Nurse Betty (2000), and others. At the Red Cliffs Lodge along Hwy. 128 (the Colorado River), at m.p.14 are displays and lists of all the movies and ads using this area.\\r\\n\\r\\nAlthough there are usually lots of tourists, I find that with a bike I can always find niches to park in to stretch or take photos. Just beware of tour busses, they don't slow down for anybody! Do stop at all the pullouts as each is a different aspect of geology. \\r\\n\\r\\nThe visitor center is pretty new and has good info.

The forested hills with the fall colors starting on both sides of the river/border was a never-ending ride of rural quietness.

The extreme weather conditions year 'round also take a toll creating frost heaves similar to speed bumps in the mall parking lots.  The overwhelming culprit of the less than desirable road quality, however, is probably the tremendous quantity of heavily laden logging trucks abusing the pavement.

Stretching nearly 400 miles across Nevada, Route 50 connects only 5 tiny cities (more details to follow in the \\\"Roadside Amenities\\\" section). Nonetheless, it is without a doubt some of the most beautiful scenery I have ever ridden through. Nevada is in fact a series of small mountain ranges that run North-South. Route 50 bisects them all. You'll have spectacular views of mountains that appear on the horizon right up until you summit them and move on to the next range. Once you reach Carson City, Nevada, you'll head up and through a mountain pass which takes you around the souther end of Lake Tahoe.\\r\\n\\r\\nCALIFORNIA: Starting right at the state line of California and Nevada, you'll start to descend down through the California side of Lake Tahoe. This part of the ride was probably the most fun. I'd estimate you take around 150 turns in a short 40 miles of windy mountain roads. It was especially nice to get out of the sun, since this part of Route 50 was shrouded by pine and eucalyptus, as well as loads of other local flora and fauna.

The creek is very popular with trout fishermen and was part of the most productive gold-producing areas during the gold rush.  You will still see people panning for gold in the creek.  This is a top motorcycle road for those who like the twists and turns.  Going earlier in the day will insure a better run.  There are a few passing zones to get around the slower traffic.\\r\\n\\r\\nMost of the Denver traffic that is headed to the mountains will be on I-70, which this route avoids.  So this Clear Creek Canyon run is mostly used by sight seers, outdoor enthusiasts, and motorcyclists.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter making the top of the canyon, you will turn back to the east on service roads that parallel I-70 and drop into Evergreen.  These are pleasant country roads, with a bit of divided highway called Evergreen Parkway.  Watch for elk - hopefully off the road!  They are quite common as you approach Evergreen, especially as you pass Elk Meadow Park and approach Evergreen Lake.\\r\\n\\r\\nEvergreen is a popular destination, and you will see motorcycle friendly establishments on both sides of the road as you pass through town.\\r\\n\\r\\nLeaving Evergreen, you will immediately enter Bear Creek Canyon and descend into Morrison.  This is a shorter canyon run, but just as much fun.  Forget about any (safe, legal) passing in this canyon.  You will find a couple of small towns and a handful of nice parks along the way down this canyon.\\r\\n\\r\\nAt the bottom of the canyon, just before you enter Morrison, you will see the Red Rocks park and Amphitheater entrance on the left.  If you haven't seen this, take the side trip!  This is the famous outdoor concert venue, set amongst awesome rock formations.  If they aren't setting up for a concert, you can actually go up into the amphitheater and stand on the stage.  Very cool!  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe trip ends in Morrison, also obviously a motorcycle destination town (a sign encourages idle speed through town to keep the sound down).\\r\\n\\r\\nYou can get back to Golden quickly via I-470, as described in the directions.

The next gas station will be in Evergreen.\\r\\nThere aren't many amenities along the route until you get to Evergreen.  The route was planned to avoid population.  However, Evergreen has a good share of restaurants - some with designated motorcycle parking out front (watch the left side of this route as you go through the center of Evergreen).  Beau Jo's, on right side of the route as you go through town, has good pizza and creek-side tables on Bear Creek.  This is right off a public parking lot on the right.

On a clear day (and there are many of these here) you will see impressive views of the west slope of the Grant Teton mountain range.  Before long you will descend into the canyon of the Henry 's Fork of the Snake River and on into the Warm River canyon.  Almost immediately you climb out of the river canyon on a two-lane road that winds through the Targhee National Forest.  There are multiple pull-outs on the east side of the road that offer breathtaking views of the river canyon and surrounding mountains.  Before long you will see signs for Lower and then Upper Mesa Falls.  Most of the rest of the ride is flat and meandering through the floor of the Island Park caldera, eventually leaving forest behind as you approach the intersection at Hwy 20.   \\r\\n\\r\\nDETAILED SCENERY DESCRIPTION:\\r\\nNOTE: This route is not open during the winter months - check for access before you go.\\r\\n\\r\\n1) The first part of this ride winds across the floor of the Island Park super-volcano crater through ponderosa pines of the Caribou-Targhee National Forest.  \\r\\n\\r\\n2) Keep your eye on the horizon to the south as you ride on.  On a clear day you will see absolutely breathtaking views of the main peaks of the Grand Tetons.  \\r\\n\\r\\n3) About 17 miles into the ride you will leave the floor of the Island Park caldera and start riding along a ridge between the Snake River canyon to the west and the Warm River Canyon to the east.  There are multiple pull-outs on the east side of the road, and you can see the Warm River far below you from some of these.  \\r\\n\\r\\n4) You will gradually descend in elevation toward the Warm River over the next few miles and you will be able to see the Warm River Campground to your left as you come out of the trees toward the floor of the river valley.\\r\\n\\r\\n5) You will cross a bridge over the Warm River and there is a pullout to the right immediately after that bridge.  This is a fish observation area.  Fishing is not allowed here, and there are often many HUGE trout in there.  If you have some bread, crackers, marshmallows, toss them out there, and if the fish are there, they will let you know!\\r\\n\\r\\n6) In the last 9 miles of the byway, you will climb out of the river valley onto gently rolling hills of potato fields.  Look to your left (east) as you ride and you will be treated to absolutely fantastic views of the Tetons.\", \"drive_enjoyment_description\": \"This is a lightly traveled two-lane road.  It is not maintained (plowed) during the winter, and in the Spring there are often small to medium sized pot-holes to be aware of.  The road includes long straight-aways followed by twisting mountain roads, gentle sweeping curves and more straight-aways.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe upper end of the ride is largely a series of straight segments with gentle curves between them.  South of the Upper and Lower Mesa Falls, there is a series of easily managed twisties as you descend toward the Warm River Canyon.  \\r\\n\\r\\nWatch for cattle as you ride through the upper part of the route, since you will ride through some unfenced, open-grazing zones.  Watch for cattle guards.\\r\\n\\r\\nThere are a few potholes here and there, but the speed limit of 45 should give you time to spot and avoid these.\", \"tourism_description\": \"Things to see/do along this route include (IMHO) the best bacon cheeseburger and fries in the region at El Rincon Restaurant or great ice cream at Dave's Jubilee (grocery store deli), both in Ashton, ID.  Must see-stops include a fish observation site just before you reach the bridge over the Warm River (toss crackers, etc., and watch 20-30\\\" trout come up for them).  The Warm River offers a much-overlooked fishing opportunity as well.  Don't miss the Lower and Upper Mesa Falls State Park facilities (small parking fee).  For scenery, this ride is hard to beat!\\r\\n\\r\\nMORE DETAILED GUIDE:\\r\\n1) About 14.5 miles into the (north-south) ride, you will see signs for Upper Mesa Falls.  This is a must-see stop, and features a 114' waterfall as impressive as most of the sights you can see in Yellowstone NP.  This site is run by the US Forest Service, and there is a modest parking fee ($5).  There is a visitor's center, rangers can answer questions, and there is a nice walkway/stairway that takes you to overlooks of the 114' waterfall on the Henry's Fork of the Snake River.  Restrooms and water are available here.\\r\\n\\r\\n2) Two miles farther down the road the byway you will see signs for Lower Mesa Falls.  These falls are not at tall, but, IMO, they are every bit as beautiful.  There is no parking fee for this stop.  Keep an eye out for birds while you are here - osprey and peregrine falcons are common in this area.  There are also restrooms here.\\r\\n\\r\\n3) Four miles farther south along the route, you will see the Warm River \\r\\nCampground on the banks of the Warm River to your left.  There is a use-fee to stay in this campground, but if you park outside and walk in, there is no charge.  There are also restrooms and water available here.  This river is stocked every year with rainbow trout, so the fishing is usually pretty good.  There are also brown and brook trout if you go farther upstream.\\r\\n\\r\\n4) The route ends as you roll into the small farming town of Ashton, ID.  If you are hungry, my top recommendation is the El Rincon Restaurant (located on the south side of Main St.).  They have excellent, authentic Mexican food, plus they make a mean bacon cheeseburger (the best in the region, IMO). \\r\\n\\r\\n5) If all you want is an ice cream cone, then go all the way through Ashton, get back on Hwy 20 south and take an immediate right to Dave's Jubilee.  They always have several options of hard ice cream, and the portions are quite generous.\", \"state_prop_rank\": 0.59375, \"sinuosity\": 1.1476326694650378, \"route_length\": 25.984690279846514, \"loc_lat\": 44.17384230350242, \"loc_lon\": -111.36421459763892}, {\"gpx_file_num\": 60451, \"name\": \"The Snake River to Super Volcano to Earthquake Lake to West Yellow Stone Run\", \"state\": \"Montana\", \"user_rating\": 3.5, \"num_user_reviews\": 4, \"num_users_rode\": 0, \"num_users_want2ride\": 5, \"scenery_rating\": 5, \"drive_enjoyment_rating\": 4, \"tourism_rating\": 5, \"state_rank\": 15, \"num_state_routes\": 29, \"scenery_description\": \"This ride has something for everyone.

As a result the road surface isn't as nice as Tioga although they are redoing some of it this year (2020-21)\\r\\n\\r\\nStart at Sonora (larger city) or Twain Harte listed here.  Sonora is an old gold mining town and if you're interested there is a state historical park named Columbia to the north where you can take stagecoach rides, pan for gold, look at an 1800's town, etc.\\r\\n\\r\\nHead northeast through some sleepy mountain towns, views of the high sierras and to my favorite pizza place in CA, Mia's Tavern (mias.com) in Cold Springs, CA.  Great place for lunch.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter leaving Cold Springs, head through Strawberry and on up towards Sonora pass.  On the way if you'd like a scenic overlook consider the Donnell Vista overlook, my family and I love the view of the reservoir below and mountains beyond.  Rejoin the road and head towards Sonora Pass.  The run up to the pass is mostly gentle turns and then it finally gets into some twisty turns with some vertical rises and drops.  Eventually you will hit the switchback section where it really works to drop the elevation down.\\r\\nAfter a while you will leave that area and hit a flatter section where it will mostly gently wind back and forth as you head towards the junction.  On your left you will eventually see a Marine Corps Mountain Warfare Training Center and then finally the Sonora junction/395.\\r\\n\\r\\nSide note:  If you are making this ride a multi day event, try heading north from here and picking up the 88/89 near South Lake Tahoe and heading back inland or simply riding around Tahoe.

Homemade baked goods, fresh apple cider, miniature train ride, petting zoo.

Gentle sloping lake shores with a nice wide beach.  Excellent dirt walking trail around the lake if you like walks.  There is camping here as well and in the past they have done free movie nights at an ampatheater.

For absolute best viewing there is a one lane dirt road known as the Florida Birding Trail that goes thru the actual marsh, but that road is only open in the Winter months on Friday, Saturday and Sunday's.   During Summer months only the boat ramp is open but worth the short side trip down a well marked dirt road to see the that part of the Marsh.   Lots of animal sightings on this section of Emeralda Marsh road.  I run this route often and routinely see everything from Gators, to Otters to Bears, and just about any type of bird native to Florida.  Better have your GoPro rolling.  Beautiful sections of Spanish Moss covered trees.  This entire 100 mile route is typical rural Florida country scenery.  Trees and small bends in the road most of the way with Hwy 19 being straight as an arrow.    Very little traffic control as well.    Only a few stop signs one blinking light and maybe 5 stop lights  tops the entire 100 mile route.  Usually very light traffic weekdays, but on the weekends Hwy 19 can get congested.   But this route is best done in the winter when the birding trail is open.   It's a five mile dirt road through some really beautiful marsh area.

The speed limit most of the way is 45 mph and the limit never gets over 55 mph.   I've never seen Lake county work it, but Marion County frequently sets up radar on 314A and 314.   The section of Marion county 314A north of Marion county hwy 40 is very rough for the first 5 miles.   Staying to the right and riding the fog line keeps you out of the really rough stuff.

The Junction of Marion 314A and Marion County hwy 40 has more to offer in the way of fuel and a few small shops and a Winn-Dixie.  Salt Springs has three convenience stores and Altoona has only two.   Both at the only traffic light where Hwy 42 crosses.   There is a small shop that sells local honey in Altoona.  I buy all mine there.   It's one block south of the traffic light on the west side of Hwy 19.   The really good thing about this route is you're  in the dead center of the Ocala National Forest.  There are a million other little side trips you can take from this route.  There are several Springs and resorts to visit along the way.    Alexander Springs is one of the more popular.  On the section of Hwy 19 between Salt Springs and Marion hwy 40 on the east side of Hwy 19 is a small rest area called Juniper Wayside.   Excellent video op down at the end of the parking lot.   Beautiful crystal clear water with plenty of fish in the springs.   This is very popular kayaking spot.   If you're into riding to a spot then hiking a bit.  I highly recommend The birding trail in the Emeralda Marsh.   There is a trail head less than three miles from the Lisbon Church of God.   You can hike the trail to it's end which is about five miles up and five back.    There are also several other hiking trails along this route as well.   There is also another trail head about two miles past the boat ramp on the right side of Emeralda Marsh Road.   The Ocala National Forest is HUGE.  Cell phone service varies.

(PLEASE NOTE: Just before you get to North Adams, while coming down from the Florida State Forest you will make a 600 foot decent in 1500 feet with a hairpin turn at the \\\"Golden Eagle restaurant\\\". USE CAUTION AS TRUCKS COMING UP THE MOUNTAIN NEED A WIDE SWING TO MAKE THE TURN!\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom there you're into North Adams and onto Beaver St (Route 8 North.)\\r\\nRoute 8 is a scenic rural road that follows the Deerfield River and is in a valley.  \\r\\nonce you pass into Vermont, on either side of the road you'll see farms and fields, then further out are the mountains of the Green Mountain National Forest. In the next half hour, you will change elevations in the river valley at 800 feet to over 2400 feet by the time you get to Route 9. It may not sound like a lot, but if it's 75 degrees starting out you could see 60 degrees in that half hour... Bring a jacket!\\r\\n\\r\\nComing to Vermont Route 9 and turning right (East) there is not a lot of opportunity for gas and food, but the mountains and foliage on either side of the valley will be spectacular! It is only a little further until you reach Wilmington VT. and here is another quaint New England town with lots of specialty shops and restaurants. Well worth a look around. It is also a good spot to take a rest (even though you've only be riding for 45 minutes because once you leave Wilmington, the ride gets pretty challenging again. After you pass the Southern Vermont Natural History Museum (well worth the stop too...) and Hog Back Mountain... you will have to negotiate no less than 10 major bends (greater than 90 degrees) in the road over the next 10 miles. (Sure, it's no Tail of the Dragon, but it does require paying attention...) Then you are into West Brattleboro and onto Route 142 along the Connecticut River.\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen you follow the River on 142 and look over to your left and across the river...
